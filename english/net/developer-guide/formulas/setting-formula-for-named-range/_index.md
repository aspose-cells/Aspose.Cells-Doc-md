## **Setting Formula for Named Range**
Like Excel application, Aspose.Cells APIs provide the ability to specify a formula for a named range while using its [RefersTo](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/properties/refersto) property. There could be numerous usability scenarios for this feature, a few of which are detailed as follow.
### **Setting a Simple Formula for Named Range**
A simple formula could be a reference to another cell in the same (or different) worksheet. The following example creates a named range in a new spreadsheet and sets its reference to another cell.

### **Setting a Complex Formula for Named Range**
A complex formula could be anything such as a dynamic range or a formula spanning over multiple cells in different worksheets. The following example creates a dynamic range using the INDEX function to get the value from a list based on its location.

Here is another example that uses a named range to sum values from 2 cells in different worksheets.
