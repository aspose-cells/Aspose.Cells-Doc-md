## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Aspose.Cells APIs have exposed the [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class in order to deal with the scenarios where the user wishes to use custom labels for Subtotals in a spreadsheet. Moreover, the [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class can also be used to modify the **Other** label for the Pie chart while rendering worksheet or chart.

## **Introduction to GlobalizationSettings Class**

The [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class currently offers the following 3 methods which can be overridden in a custom class to get desired labels for the Subtotals or to render custom text for the **Other** label of a Pie chart.

1. [**GlobalizationSettings.GetTotalName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/gettotalname): Gets the total name of the function.
1. [**GlobalizationSettings.GetGrandTotalName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/getgrandtotalname): Gets the grand total name of the function.
1. [**GlobalizationSettings.GetOtherName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/getothername): Gets the name of "Other" labels for Pie charts.

### **Custom Labels for Subtotals**

The [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class can be used to customize the Subtotal labels by overriding the [**GlobalizationSettings.GetTotalName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/gettotalname) & [**GlobalizationSettings.GetGrandTotalName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/getgrandtotalname) methods as demonstrated ahead.

In order to inject custom labels, it is required to assign the [**WorkbookSettings.GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/globalizationsettings) property to an instance of the **CustomSettings** class defined above before adding the Subtotals to the worksheet.

The [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class only works for adding new Subtotals. If a spreadsheet already contains Subtotals, their labels cannot be modified.

### **Custom Text for Other Label of Pie Chart**

The [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class offers [**GetOtherName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/getothername) method which is useful to give the "Other" label of Pie charts a custom value. The following snippet defines a custom class and overrides the [**GetOtherName**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings/methods/getothername) method to get a custom label based on the system's culture identifier.

The following snippet loads an existing spreadsheet containing a Pie chart and renders the chart to an image while utilizing the **CustomSettings** class created above.
