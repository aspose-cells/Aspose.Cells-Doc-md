## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Earlier, you **had** to change the culture info of the entire thread to deal with numbers and dates in a particular culture format, but now Aspose.Cells provides the [LoadOptions.CultureInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/loadoptions/properties/cultureinfo) property, which you can use to load your workbook with specific culture info without changing the culture info of the entire thread.

## **Load the Workbook with Specific System Culture Info**
The following sample code shows how to load the workbook with specific system culture **info** to deal with dates.
