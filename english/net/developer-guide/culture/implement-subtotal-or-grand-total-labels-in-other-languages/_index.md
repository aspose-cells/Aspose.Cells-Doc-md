## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Sometimes, you want to show subtotal and grand total labels in non‑English languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, etc. Aspose.Cells allows you to do this using the [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class and the [**Workbook.GlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/globalizationsettings) property. Please see this article on how to make use of the **GlobalizationSettings** class.

Please check the [output Excel file](5115152.xlsx) generated by this code for your reference. We first create an instance of the **GlobalizationSettings** class and then use it in our code.
