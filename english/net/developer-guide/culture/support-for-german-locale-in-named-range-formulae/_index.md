English formulas are written into a named region. This Excel file can be opened in an environment where the system is configured to the German locale; however, the English formula will be translated into German. The following example demonstrates this feature; however, it requires Excel to be installed in the German language and the system locale to be set to German as well.

A sample file for testing this feature can be downloaded from the following link:
