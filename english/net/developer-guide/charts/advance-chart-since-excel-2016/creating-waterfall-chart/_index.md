A waterfall chart is a special type of chart that is normally used to demonstrate how the starting position changes, either increasing or decreasing. Microsoft Excel has many predefined chart types, including column, line, pie, bar, radar, etc., but the waterfall chart is not among the basic graphs and can be created using existing chart types with little or extensive customization.

Aspose.Cells API allows you to create a waterfall chart with the help of a line chart. The API also allows customizing the chart appearance to give it the shape of the waterfall by setting the [**Series.UpBars**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/series/properties/upbars) & [**Series.DownBars**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/series/properties/downbars) properties.

The code snippet below demonstrates the usage of the Aspose.Cells for .NET API to create a waterfall chart from scratch.
