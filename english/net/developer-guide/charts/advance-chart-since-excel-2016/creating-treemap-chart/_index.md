## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
A treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and makes it easy to spot patterns, such as which items are the store's best sellers. **The** tree branches are represented by rectangles, and each sub‑branch is shown as a smaller rectangle. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity, and can easily show large amounts of data that would be difficult to present with other chart types.
