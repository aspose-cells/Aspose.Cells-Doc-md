## **Defines an inheritance class**

First step, you need to define a class "ChartJapaneseSetttings" that inherit from [**ChartGlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/). 
Then, by rewriting the related functions, you can set the text of the chart elements in your own language.
Code example:
{{< gist "aspose-cells-gists" "59a1901d62ea9ceb08456a818431a898" "ChartJapaneseSetttings.cs" >}}

## **Config Japanese Setting For Chart**

In this step, you will use the class "ChartJapaneseSetttings" you defined in the previous step.
Code example:

```
	Workbook wb = new Workbook("Japanese.xls");
	wb.Settings.GlobalizationSettings.ChartSettings = new ChartJapaneseSetttings();
	Chart chart0 = wb.Worksheets[0].Charts[0];
	chart0.ToImage("Output.png");
```

Then you can see the effect in the output image, the elements in the chart will be rendered according to your settings.

## **Conclusion**

In this example, if you do not set Japanese Region for a chart, the following chart elements may be rendered in the default language, such as English.
After the above operation, we can get an output chart picture with Japanese Region.
