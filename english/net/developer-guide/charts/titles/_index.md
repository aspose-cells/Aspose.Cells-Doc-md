## **Setting the Titles of Charts or Axes**
You can use Microsoft Excel to set the titles of a chart and its axes in a WYSIWYG environment. Aspose.Cells also allows developers to set the titles of a chart and its axes at runtime. All charts and their axes contain a [Title](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/properties/title) property that can be used to set their titles as shown below in an example.
