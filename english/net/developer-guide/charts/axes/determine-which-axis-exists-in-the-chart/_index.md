Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the chart. For example, he wants to know if a secondary value axis exists in the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have axes.

Aspose.Cells provides [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/methods/hasaxis) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/methods/hasaxis) to determine if the sample chart has primary and secondary category and value axes.
