HTML can have a variety of tag formats for empty tags, such as `<td></td>` or `<td/>`. Aspose.Cells now supports both of these formats, whereas earlier it only supported `<td></td>`‑style tags. This feature can be tested by converting the attached sample HTML file to an Excel file. The sample HTML file and output Excel file can be downloaded from the following links for testing.
