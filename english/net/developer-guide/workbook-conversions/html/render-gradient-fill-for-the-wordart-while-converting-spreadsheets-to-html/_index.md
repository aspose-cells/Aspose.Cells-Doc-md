## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Before Aspose.Cells 17.1, Aspose.Cells did not render the gradient fill of WordArt when the Excel file was converted to HTML format. Since the release of Aspose.Cells 17.1, WordArt gradient fill is supported. The following screenshot compares the gradient‑fill effect when converting the Excel file using Aspose.Cells 17.1 and an older version.
