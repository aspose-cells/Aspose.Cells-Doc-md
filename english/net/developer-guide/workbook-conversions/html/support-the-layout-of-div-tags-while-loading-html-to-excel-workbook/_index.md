Normally, the layout of DIV tags is ignored while loading HTML into an Excel workbook object. However, if you want the layout of DIV tags not to be ignored, please set the [HTMLLoadOptions.SupportDivTag](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/htmlloadoptions/properties/supportdivtag) property to **true**. The default value of this property is **false**.
