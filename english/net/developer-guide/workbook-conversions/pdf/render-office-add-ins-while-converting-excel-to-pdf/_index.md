## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Earlier, Aspose.Cells could not render Office Add‑Ins when the Excel file was saved to PDF format. Now Aspose.Cells renders them correctly. You do not need to use any special method or property to render Office Add‑Ins in the output PDF. Simply save your Excel file to PDF format and it will render the Office Add‑ins.

## **Render Office Add‑Ins while converting Excel to PDF**

The following sample code saves the [sample Excel file](60489769.xlsx), which contains the Office Add‑Ins. Please see the [output PDF generated with the previous version, i.e., 17.11](60489770.pdf) and the [output PDF generated with the newer version, i.e., 17.12 and onward](60489771.pdf). The PDF generated by the previous version is blank, but the PDF generated by the newer version shows the Office Add‑Ins.
