For compatibility with older versions, Aspose.Cells renders gridline as dotted line by default while converting Excel to PDF. However, modern Excel renders gridline as solid line in nowadays.

With option [PdfSaveOptions.GridlineTypes](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions/gridlinetype/), Aspose.Cells can also render gridline as solid line.
