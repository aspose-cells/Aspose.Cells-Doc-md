Aspose.Cells now fully supports converting revisions of an XLSB file into an XLSM file. Revisions are found inside the path `\xl\revisions`. You can view them by changing your XLSB file extension to ZIP. The `\xl\revisions` path contains files ending with `.bin` extensions.  

When you convert your XLSB file into an XLSM file using Aspose.Cells, these `.bin` files successfully convert to `.xml` files as shown in these two screenshots.
