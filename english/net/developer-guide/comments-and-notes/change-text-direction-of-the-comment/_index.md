Microsoft Excel allows users to add comments to cells to add additional information and highlight data. Developers may need to customize the comment to specify alignment settings and text direction. Aspose.Cells provides APIs to accomplish the task.

Aspose.Cells provides a [**Shape.TextDirection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/textdirection) property to set text direction for a comment. The following sample code demonstrates the use of the **Shape.TextDirection** property to set the text direction for a comment.
