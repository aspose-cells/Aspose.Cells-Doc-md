## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

If you want to associate slicer and pivot table in Excel, you need to right-click slicer and select "Report Connections..." item. In the option list, you can operate on the check box. Similarly, if you want to associate slicer and pivot table using Aspose.Cells API programmatically, please use the [**Slicer.AddPivotConnection(PivotTable pivot)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/addpivotconnection/) method. It will associate slicer and pivot table.

## **Associate Slicer and PivotTable**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](add-pivot-connection.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It accesses the Slicer and then associates Slicer and PivotTable. Finally, it saves the workbook as [output Excel file](add-pivot-connection-out.xlsx).
