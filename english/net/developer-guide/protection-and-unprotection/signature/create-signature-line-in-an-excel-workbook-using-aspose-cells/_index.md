## **Introduction**

Microsoft Excel provides a feature to add **Signature Line** in Excel workbooks. You can add a signature line by clicking the **Insert** tab and then selecting **Signature Line** from the **Text** group.

Aspose.Cells also provides this feature and exposes the [**Picture.SignatureLine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/properties/signatureline) property for this purpose. This article explains how to use this property to add a signature line using Aspose.Cells.

The following sample code adds a signature line using the [**Picture.SignatureLine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/properties/signatureline) property and saves the workbook.
