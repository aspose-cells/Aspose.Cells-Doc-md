Often you need to know the version number of the application that created a Microsoft Excel document. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Version**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/version) property for this purpose.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [**Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Version**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/version) property. It loads Excel files created with Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013, and prints the version number of the application that created these Excel documents.
