## **Data Formatting**

Formatting is used to distinguish between different types of information and to display data clearly.

A format represents a style and is defined as a set of characteristics, such as fonts and font sizes, number formats, cell borders, cell shading, indentation, alignment and text orientation. Borders provide further ways to highlight information. A border is a line drawn around a cell or a group of cells.

Number formats also make data more meaningful. By applying different number formats, you can change the appearance of numbers without changing the number behind the appearance.

Aspose.Cells provides lets you draw borders around cells and ranges easily. It also lets you apply fonts and shade cells. The component is efficient enough that you can format a complete row or column, set alignments, wrap and rotate text in cells. Aspose.Cells further supports all number formats supported by Microsoft Excel.
