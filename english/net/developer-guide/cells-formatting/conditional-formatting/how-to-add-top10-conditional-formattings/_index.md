1. Spot Trends and Outliers: Instantly identify the top performers (e.g., top 10 sales reps, best grades, highest revenue months).Makes it easy to analyze without sorting data.
1. Data Visualization: Adds color cues that make important data points stand out visually.Helps viewers of the spreadsheet understand the key values at a glance.
1. Quick Comparisons: Useful in dashboards and reports where you want to highlight excellence or peaks.
1. Dynamic Updates: If your data changes, the conditional formatting updates automatically to reflect the new top values.
