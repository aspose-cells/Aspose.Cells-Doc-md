You can use Aspose.Cells to export your worksheet or chart into an image with the desired width and height. It provides [**ImageOrPrintOptions.SetDesiredSize()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/methods/setdesiredsize) method to set the desired width and height of the exported image. The width and height are specified in the unit of pixels.
