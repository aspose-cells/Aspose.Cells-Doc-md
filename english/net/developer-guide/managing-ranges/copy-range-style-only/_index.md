[Copy Range Data Only](/cells/net/copy-range-data-only/) and [Copy Range Data with Style](/cells/net/copy-range-data-with-style/) explain how to copy data from one range to another, either on its own or together with formatting. It is also possible to copy only the formatting. This article shows how.

This example creates a workbook, populates it with data, and copies a range's style only.

1. Create a range.  
2. Create a [**Style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/style) object with specified formatting attributes.  
3. Apply the style formatting to the range.  
4. Create a second range of cells.  
5. Copy the first range's formatting to the second range.
