Microsoft Office replaced menus and toolbars with a Ribbon at the top of the application window since office 2007. The Ribbon is customizable. 
Aspose.Cells allows you to

- Keep Ribbon XML without parsing it,
- Read and write Ribbon XML without parsing it,
- Get and set Ribbon XML data.

If you want to change the Ribbon XML, you have to parse it with an XML parser or other Ribbon XML tool.
