## **Get Hyperlinks in Range**

The [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range) class provides a [**Hyperlinks**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/properties/hyperlinks) property which returns all the hyperlinks in the selected range. You may also delete a hyperlink by calling the [**Hyperlink.Delete**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/hyperlink/methods/delete) method.
