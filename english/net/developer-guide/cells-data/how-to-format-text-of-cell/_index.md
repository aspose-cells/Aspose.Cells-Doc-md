## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Formatting partial characters within a cell allows for emphasizing specific words or data points while maintaining a structured and readable layout. Here’s why you might do it:

1. Highlighting Important Information: You can bold, italicize, or color specific words to draw attention (e.g., "Total: $500"). Useful for emphasizing key terms in reports or dashboards.
1. Enhancing Readability: Differentiating sections within a single cell (e.g., "Name: John Doe, Age: 30"). Helps users quickly identify relevant details.
1. Maintaining Context in Mixed Data: When a cell contains different types of information, such as labels and values (e.g., "Status: Approved"). This avoids the need for multiple columns or splitting data.
1. Better Visual Appeal: Partial formatting makes spreadsheets look professional and polished. Improves engagement in presentations and reports.
1. Conditional Emphasis: You can change colors for warnings, approvals, or important notes dynamically. Example: "Balance: -$200" (negative balance in red).
