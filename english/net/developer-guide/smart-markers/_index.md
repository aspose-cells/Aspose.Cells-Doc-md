## **Introduction**
**Smart markers** are used to let Aspose.Cells know what information to place in a Microsoft Excel designer spreadsheet. Smart markers allow you to create templates that contain only specific information and formatting.

## **Sample Code for Using Nested Objects in Smart Markers**
Aspose.Cells supports nested objects in smart markers, the nested objects should be simple. We use a simple template file. See the designer spreadsheet that contains some nested smart markers.

The example that follows shows how this works.
