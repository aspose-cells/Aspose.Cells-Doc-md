Aspose.Cells provides the feature to replace text in a workbook using a regular expression. For this, the API provides [**RegexKey**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) property of the [**ReplaceOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/replaceoptions) class. Setting the [**RegexKey**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) to **true** indicates that the searched key will be a regular expression.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [**RegexKey**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) property by using the [sample excel file](101089318.xlsx). The [output file](101089319.xlsx) generated by the following code snippet is attached for reference.
