## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Microsoft Excel allows you to share the workbook as shown in the following screenshot. When you share the workbook, then more than one user can edit the workbook on the network. Aspose.Cells enables you to create a shared workbook with [**Workbook.Settings.Shared**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/shared) property.
