Aspose.Cells provides [**Shape.Geometry.ShapeAdjustValues**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/properties/shapeadjustvalues) property to make changes to the adjustment points of shapes. In the Microsoft Excel UI, adjustments display as yellow diamond nodes. For example:

- Rounded Rectangle has an adjustment to change the arc
- Triangle has an adjustment to change the location of the point
- Trapezoid has an adjustment to change the width of the top
- Arrows have two adjustments to change the shape of the head and tail

This article will explain the use of [**Shape.Geometry.ShapeAdjustValues**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/properties/shapeadjustvalues) property to change the adjustment values of the different shapes.
