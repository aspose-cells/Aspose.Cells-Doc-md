## Load an Image from a URL into an Excel Worksheet

Aspose.Cells for .NET API provides a simple and easy way to load images from URLs into Excel worksheets. This article explains downloading the image data into a stream and then inserting it into the worksheet using the Aspose.Cells API. Using this method, the image becomes part of the Excel file and is not downloaded every time the worksheet is opened.

## Sample Code

There may be cases where you always want the updated image from a URL. To achieve this, you may follow the instructions given in the [Insert a Linked Picture from Web Address](/cells/net/insert-a-linked-picture-from-web-address/) article. By following this method, the image is loaded from the URL each time the worksheet is opened.
