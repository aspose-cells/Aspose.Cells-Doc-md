## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location, how they will be visible is decided by their z‑order positions. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/tofrontorback) method, which changes the z‑order position of a shape. If you want to send a shape to the back, you will use a negative number such as -1, -2, -3, etc., and if you want to send a shape to the front, you will use a positive number such as 1, 2, 3, etc.

## **Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**

The following sample code explains the usage of the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/tofrontorback) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528330.xlsx) used by the code and the [output Excel file](50528331.xlsx) generated from it.
