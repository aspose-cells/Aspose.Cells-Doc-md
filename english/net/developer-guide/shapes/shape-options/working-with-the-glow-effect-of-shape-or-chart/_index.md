## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/glow) property along with the [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class to work with the glow effect of a shape or chart. The [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [GlowEffect.Size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/properties/size)
- [GlowEffect.Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/properties/transparency)
- [GlowEffect.Color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/properties/color)

## **Working with the Glow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the source Excel file ([5115407.xlsx](5115407.xlsx)), accesses the first shape in the first worksheet, sets the sub‑properties of the [Shape.Glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/glow) property, and then saves the workbook to the output Excel file ([5115414.xlsx](5115414.xlsx)).
