## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) property along with [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class to work with the reflection effect of a shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [Blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/blur)
- [Direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/direction)
- [Distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/distance)
- [FadeDirection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/fadedirection)
- [RotWithShape](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/rotwithshape)
- [Size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/size)
- [Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/transparency)
- [Type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/type)

## **Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the source Excel file (`5115424.xlsx`), accesses the first shape in the default worksheet, sets different properties of the `Shape.Reflection` class, and then saves the workbook to the output Excel file (`5115423.xlsx`).
