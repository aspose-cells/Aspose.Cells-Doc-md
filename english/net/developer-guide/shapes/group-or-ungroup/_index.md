Sometimes you may want to group certain shapes, pictures, or objects in a worksheet for easier manipulation (for example, moving them to a different location, copying them, and so on). Aspose.Cells supports this functionality. You can use Aspose.Cells to group shapes, pictures, or other objects. Furthermore, you can rotate, flip, move, or resize grouped shapes, pictures, or objects as if they were individual shapes or objects. You can also ungroup and regroup shapes at any time.

This article explains in detail how to group and ungroup shapes, pictures, or other objects in a worksheet.
