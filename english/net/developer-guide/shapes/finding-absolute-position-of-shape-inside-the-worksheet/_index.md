Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.LeftToCorner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/lefttocorner) and [**Shape.TopToCorner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/toptocorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of the shape inside the worksheet in pixels.
