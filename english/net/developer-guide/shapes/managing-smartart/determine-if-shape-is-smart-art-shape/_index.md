## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

SmartArt shapes are special shapes in Microsoft Excel that allow you to create complex diagrams automatically. You can determine whether the shape is a SmartArt shape or a normal shape using the [**Shape.IsSmartArt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/issmartart) property.

## **Determine if Shape is Smart Art Shape**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](55541792.xlsx) containing a SmartArt shape as shown in this screenshot. It then prints the value of the [**Shape.IsSmartArt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/issmartart) property of the first shape. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
