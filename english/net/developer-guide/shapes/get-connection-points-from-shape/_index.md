Aspose.Cells provides rich features to manage shapes in a spreadsheet. Sometimes there is a need to get the connection points of a shape for aligning or placing the shapes at the appropriate location. For this purpose, all the connection points are required. The following code can be used to get the list of connection points of a shape by using the [Shape.ConnectionPoints](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/connectionpoints) property.
