Aspose.Cells provides the **Worksheet.QueryTables** collection, which returns an object of type **QueryTable** by index. It has the following two properties:

- **QueryTable.AdjustColumnWidth**
- **QueryTable.PreserveFormatting**

These are both Boolean values. You can view them in Microsoft Excel via **Data > Connections > Properties**.

## Reading and Writing Query Table of Worksheet

The following sample code reads the first QueryTable of the first worksheet and then prints both QueryTable properties. It then sets **QueryTable.PreserveFormatting** to **true**.
