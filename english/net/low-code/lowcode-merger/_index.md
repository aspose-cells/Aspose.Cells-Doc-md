## **Introduction**
Aspose.Cells for .NET provides the [Aspose.Cells.LowCode](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/) namespace, which simplifies common spreadsheet processing tasks. This API is designed for developers who want to accomplish high‑level operations such as HTML conversion, image conversion, JSON conversion, PDF conversion, spreadsheet conversion, spreadsheet merger, spreadsheet locker, and spreadsheet splitter with minimal effort.

The LowCode API is ideal for scenarios where quick implementation is more important than fine‑grained control. Aspose.Cells LowCode APIs provide a high‑level, declarative way to perform common spreadsheet tasks (conversion, merging, splitting, etc.) without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. Let’s take a closer look at the LowCode capabilities of Aspose.Cells for .NET.

## **Merge Multiple Spreadsheets – SpreadsheetMerger**

If you want to merge several workbooks into a single workbook, you can use the [SpreadsheetMerger](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/spreadsheetmerger/) class to perform the merging task without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. The following code demonstrates how to merge two sample files ([file1.xlsx](lowcode-merger-1.xlsx) and [file2.xlsx](lowcode-merger-2.xlsx)) into one file.

## **Merge Multiple Spreadsheets – SpreadsheetMerger & LowCodeMergeOptions**

If you want to merge several workbooks into a single workbook, you can use the [SpreadsheetMerger](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/spreadsheetmerger/) class to perform the merging task without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. [LowCodeMergeOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/lowcodemergeoptions/) lets you fine‑tune the merge behavior. The following code demonstrates how to merge two sample files ([file1.xlsx](lowcode-merger-1.xlsx) and [file2.xlsx](lowcode-merger-2.xlsx)) into one file using [SpreadsheetMerger](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/spreadsheetmerger/) and [LowCodeMergeOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/lowcodemergeoptions/).
