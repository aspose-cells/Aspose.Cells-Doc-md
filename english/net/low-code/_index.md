## **Introduction**
Aspose.Cells for .NET provides the [Aspose.Cells.LowCode](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/) namespace, which simplifies common spreadsheets processing tasks. This API is designed for developers who want to accomplish high-level operations such as html conversion, image conversion, json conversion, pdf conversion, spreadsheet conversion, spreadsheet merger, spreadsheet locker and spreadsheet splitter with minimal effort.

The LowCode API is ideal for scenarios where quick implementation is more important than fine-grained control. Aspose.Cells LowCode APIs provide a high‑level, declarative way to perform common spreadsheet tasks (conversion, merging, splitting, etc.) without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. Let’s take a closer look at the LowCode capabilities of Aspose.Cells for .NET.


## **Available Features in LowCode API**
The Aspose.Cells.LowCode namespace currently supports:

1. Converter for conversion between html files(html or mht) and other spreadsheet file formats.
2. Converter for converting template file to images.
3. Converter for conversion between json data structure and other spreadsheet file formats.
4. Converter for converting template file to pdf.
5. Converter for conversion between different spreadsheet file formats, such as xls, xlsx, xlsb, spreadsheet and so on.
6. Converter for conversion between text based formats(csv, tsv, dif…) and other spreadsheet file formats.
7. Lock spreadsheet file.
9. Merge multiple template files into one.
9. Split spreadsheet file into multiple files.

## **How to Use LowCode API**
Aspose.Cells LowCode APIs provide a high‑level, declarative way to perform common spreadsheet tasks (conversion, merging, splitting, etc.) without writing extensive boiler‑plate code.
