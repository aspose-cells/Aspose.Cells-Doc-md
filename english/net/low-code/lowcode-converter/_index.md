## **Introduction**
Aspose.Cells for .NET provides the [Aspose.Cells.LowCode](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.lowcode/) namespace, which simplifies common spreadsheets processing tasks. This API is designed for developers who want to accomplish high‑level operations such as HTML conversion, image conversion, JSON conversion, PDF conversion, spreadsheet conversion, spreadsheet merger, spreadsheet locker, and spreadsheet splitter with minimal effort.

The LowCode API is ideal for scenarios where quick implementation is more important than fine‑grained control. Aspose.Cells LowCode APIs provide a high‑level, declarative way to perform common spreadsheet tasks (conversion, merging, splitting, etc.) without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. Let’s take a closer look at the LowCode capabilities of Aspose.Cells for .NET.

## **Convert a Spreadsheet – SpreadsheetConverter**

If you want to convert a spreadsheet to other formats, you can use the **SpreadsheetConverter** class to perform the conversion without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. The following code demonstrates how to convert an XLSX file ([lowcode-converter.xlsx](lowcode-converter.xlsx)) to XLSB format using the LowCode API.

## **Convert a Spreadsheet – SpreadsheetConverter & LowCodeLoadOptions & LowCodeSaveOptions**

If you want to convert a spreadsheet to other formats, you can use the **SpreadsheetConverter** class to perform the conversion without writing extensive boiler‑plate code. **LowCodeLoadOptions** and **LowCodeSaveOptions** let you fine‑tune the conversion behavior. The following code demonstrates how to convert an XLSX file ([lowcode-converter.xlsx](lowcode-converter.xlsx)) to XLSB format using **SpreadsheetConverter**, **LowCodeLoadOptions**, and **LowCodeSaveOptions**.
