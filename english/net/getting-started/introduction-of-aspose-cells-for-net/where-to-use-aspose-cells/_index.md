Aspose.Cells is created to help developers create and manage Microsoft Excel spreadsheets programmatically. Aspose.Cells doesn't only understand spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel sheet format (XLS/XLSX) but also many other file formats such as Comma‑Separated Values (CSV), Tab‑Delimited/TSV (Text), SpreadsheetML, etc.

Aspose.Cells provides most of the features available in Microsoft Excel, but the exciting thing is that Aspose.Cells can process Excel files dynamically, which enables developers to process thousands or millions of spreadsheets very quickly.
