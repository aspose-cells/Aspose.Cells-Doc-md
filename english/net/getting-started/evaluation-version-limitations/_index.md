## **How to Get the Evaluation Version of Aspose.Cells**

You can download an evaluation version of **Aspose.Cells** for .NET from [its download page](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) on Maven repos. The evaluation version provides exactly the same capabilities as the licensed version of the product. Furthermore, the evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

Once you are happy with your evaluation of **Aspose.Cells**, you can [purchase a license](https://purchase.aspose.com) at the Aspose website. Make yourself familiar with the different subscription types offered. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the Aspose sales team.

Every Aspose license carries a one‑year subscription for free upgrades to any new versions or fixes that come out during this time. Technical support is free and unlimited and is provided both to licensed and evaluation users.

## **How to Test Aspose.Cells Without Evaluation Version Limitations**

If you want to test **Aspose.Cells** without evaluation version limitations, request a 30‑day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) for more information.

## **Evaluation Version Limitations**

The evaluation version of the **Aspose.Cells** product (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it is limited to opening 100 files in a program and adds an extra worksheet with an evaluation watermark.

The limitations are shown below:

### **1st Limitation: Number of Opened Files**

When running your program, you can only open 100 Excel files. If your application exceeds this number, an exception will be thrown.

### **2nd Limitation: Worksheet with Evaluation Watermark**
This worksheet will always appear as the active worksheet. Only in the licensed version can you set the active worksheet to another worksheet.

<br>

### **3rd Limitation: Plain Text with Evaluation Information**
In the plain‑text output file generated by Aspose.Cells, evaluation information is added at the end of the document. When saving to a plain‑text format (such as CSV or TSV), only the content of the first worksheet is output.

### **4th Limitation: PDF and Image with Evaluation Watermark**
In the output PDF or image file generated by Aspose.Cells, an evaluation watermark is pasted at the top of the document/image. You can’t hide the Evaluation Copyright Warning (the extra worksheet) in the GridWeb control; it will always be added (at the end of the worksheet tabs) in the control.

### **5th Limitation: Config File Settings (Aspose.Cells.GridWeb)**
You can't re‑specify the script path by adding the following lines of code into the configuration section (e.g., in the web.config file). The `acw_client` folder contains files, and Aspose.Cells.GridWeb uses this folder to manage its internal configuration. It holds script files, image files, and other resources that define GridWeb's behavior and other operations. The config file is used to prevent the control from using the embedded client resources (images, scripts, etc.), which is useful in some cases / scenarios. Moreover, these configuration settings in the web.config file will only take effect with the LICENSED version of the control.

**XML**

<appSettings>

<add key="aspose.cells.gridweb.acw_client_path" value="/acw_client/" />

<add key="aspose.cells.gridweb.force_script_path" value="true" />

</appSettings>
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}
These settings might be compulsory in some cases / scenarios if you are using the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control in File System Websites or MS Ajax extensions, etc.
