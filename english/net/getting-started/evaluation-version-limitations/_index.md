## **Evaluation Version Limitations**

The limitations are shown below:

### **1st Limitation: Number of Opened Files**

When running your program, you can only open 100 Excel files. If your application exceeds this number, an exception will be thrown.

### **2nd Limitation: Worksheet with Evaluation Watermark**
This worksheet will always show as the active worksheet. Only in licensed version, you can set the active worksheet to other worksheets.

In the output PDF or image file by Aspose.Cells, an evaluation watermark would be pasted at the top of the document/image.You canâ€™t hide the Evaluation Copyright Warning (the extra worksheet) in the GridWeb control too, it will always be added (at the end in the worksheet tabs) in the control.

### **5th Limitation: Config file settings (Aspose.Cells.GridWeb)**
You can't re-specify the script path by adding the following lines of code into the configuration section (e.g in the web.config file). The acw_client is a folder that contains files and Aspose.Cells.GridWeb uses this folder to manage its internal configuration, it has script files, image files and other files to specify GridWeb's behavior and set other operations. The config file is used to prevent the control from using the embedded client resources (images, scripts, etc.) which is useful in some cases / scenarios. Moreover, this configuration settings in the web.config file will only take effect with the LICENSED version of the control.

**XML**
{{< highlight csharp >}}
<appSettings>

<add key="aspose.cells.gridweb.acw_client_path" value="/acw_client/" />

<add key="aspose.cells.gridweb.force_script_path" value="true" />

</appSettings>

{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

These settings might be compulsory in some cases / scenarios if you are using Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control in File System Websites or MS Ajax extensions etc.
