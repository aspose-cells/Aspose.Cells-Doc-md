## **Aspose.Cells - Formula Calculation Engine**
The formula calculation engine is embedded in Aspose.Cells. It can not only re-calculate the formula imported from a designer spreadsheet file but also supports to calculate the results of formulas added at runtime.

**C#**

 //Instantiating a Workbook object

Workbook book = new Workbook();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet

int sheetIndex = book.Worksheets.Add();

Worksheet worksheet = book.Worksheets[sheetIndex];

Cells cells = worksheet.Cells;

Cell cell = null;

//Adding a value to "A1" cell

cell = cells["A1"];

cell.Value = 1;

//Adding a value to "A2" cell

cell = cells["A2"];

cell.Value = 2;

//Adding a value to "A3" cell

cell = cells["A3"];

cell.Value = 3;

//Adding a SUM formula to "A4" cell

cell = cells["A4"];

cell.Formula = "=SUM(A1:A3)";

//Calculating the results of formulas

book.CalculateFormula();

//Saving the Excel file

book.Save("AsposeFormulaEngine.xls");
