Data is the collection of raw facts and we create spreadsheet documents or reports to present these raw facts in a more meaningful manner. Normally, we add data to spreadsheets by ourselves but sometimes, we need to reuse existing data resources and here comes the need to import data to spreadsheets from different data sources. In this topic, we will discuss some techniques to import data to worksheets from different data sources.

**Importing Data Using Aspose.Cells** 
When you use **Aspose.Cells** to open an Excel file, all data in the file is automatically imported but Aspose.Cells also supports to import data from different data sources. A few of these data sources are listed below:

- **Array**
- **ArrayList**
- **DataTable**
- **DataColumn**
- **DataView**
- **DataGrid**
- **DataReader**
- **GridView**

Aspose.Cells provides a class, **Workbook** that represents an Excel file. Workbook class contains a Worksheets collection that allows to access each worksheet in the Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the Worksheet class. Worksheet class provides a Cells collection.

Cells collection provides very useful methods to import data from different data sources.
