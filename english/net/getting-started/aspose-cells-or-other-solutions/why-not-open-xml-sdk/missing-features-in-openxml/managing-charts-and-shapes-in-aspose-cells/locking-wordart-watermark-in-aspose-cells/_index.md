Aspose.Cells APIs allow to add WordArt watermarks on the worksheet in a way that the WordArt becomes an object that you can be moved and positioned on the worksheet. It is also possible to lock the WordArt object for any interaction such as editing, movement & selection. This article explains the usage of Shape.SetLockedProperty method to lock a few aspects of the watermark.

Aspose.Cells APIs allow to lock certain aspects of the watermark so that the user interaction could be limited or completely blocked. The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Cells for .NET API to lock selection, movement, editing and re-sizing of the watermark by creating a spreadsheet from scratch.

**C#**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 string FilePath = @"..\..\..\Sample Files\";

string FileName = FilePath + "Locking WordArt Watermark.xlsx";

//Instantiate a new Workbook

Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Get the first default sheet

Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Add Watermark

Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Shape wordart = sheet.Shapes.AddTextEffect(MsoPresetTextEffect.TextEffect1,

"CONFIDENTIAL", "Arial Black", 50, false, true

, 18, 8, 1, 1, 130, 800);

//Lock Shape Aspects

wordart.IsLocked = true;

wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Selection, true);

wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.ShapeType, true);

wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Move, true);

wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Resize, true);

wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Text, true);

//Get the fill format of the word art

MsoFillFormat wordArtFormat = wordart.FillFormat;

//Set the color

wordArtFormat.ForeColor = Color.Red;

//Set the transparency

wordArtFormat.Transparency = 0.9;

//Make the line invisible

MsoLineFormat lineFormat = wordart.LineFormat;

lineFormat.IsVisible = false;

//Save the file

workbook.Save(FileName);
