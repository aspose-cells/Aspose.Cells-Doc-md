{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Sometimes, it is necessary to include links to external files in formulas, for example to evaluate a cell or range value against them. Aspose.Cells provides this feature and this document explains how to use it.

{{% /alert %}} 

The sample code below shows how to include external files in formulas.

**C#**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 string FilePath = @"..\..\..\Sample Files\";

string FileName = FilePath + "Set External Links in Formula.xlsx";

//Instantiate a new Workbook.

Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Get first Worksheet

Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Get Cells collection

Aspose.Cells.Cells cells = sheet.Cells;

//Set formula with external links

cells["A1"].Formula = "=SUM('[book1.xls]Sheet1'!A2, '[book1.xls]Sheet1'!A4)";

//Set formula with external links

cells["A2"].Formula = "='[book1.xls]Sheet1'!A8";

//Save the workbook

workbook.Save(FileName);

{{< /highlight >}}
