Sometimes, you do need a number of worksheets with common formatting and data. For example, if you work with quarterly budgets, you might want to create a workbook with sheets that contain the same column headings, row headings, and formulas. There is a way to do this: by creating one sheet and then copying it.
Aspose.Cells supports copying and moving worksheets within or between workbooks. Worksheet, complete with data, formatting, tables, matrices, charts, images and other objects, are copied with the highest degree of precision.
