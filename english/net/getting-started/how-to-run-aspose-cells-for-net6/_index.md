## Overview

For the .NET6 (or later) platforms, compare to previous platforms (.netcore31 or before), an important difference is about the graphics library. 
In this official [Microsoft Document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only), it explains for .NET6 or later releases the graphics library "System.Drawing.Common" will be only supported on Windows, and gives recommendations to replace the graphics library.

For Apose.Cells product, we have conducted the evaluation and have completed the migration of the graphics library. We use SkiaSharp instead of System.Drawing.Common in non-Windows systems, as suggested in Microsoft's official documentation. Please note that this critical change will take effect in Aspose.Cells 22.10.1 or later for .Net6.

For .netcore31 or before, for compatibility and stability, currently we still use the "System.Drawing.Common" graphics library. The dependencies for .netcore31 or before are as follows:
- System.Drawing.Common, 5.0.3.
- System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs, 6.0.5.
- System.Text.Encoding.CodePages, 4.7.0.

## Run Aspose.Cells for .Net6 (or gerter) on Windows

First you can create a .net6 (or gerter) application with VS2022, then you can choose the following installation options:

### Install through nuget

1. Search for Aspose.Cells from NuGet: [Aspose.Cells for .NET NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Cells/). 
You can also install Aspose.Cells from the Nuget package manager in VS2022.

2. "SkiaSharp" or "System.Drawing.Common" will be installed automatically as a dependency of Aspose.Cells 22.10.1 or later for .Net6 (or gerter) platforms, which depends on "Target OS" configuration in your project.
- Set the "Target OS" to "Windows" for your project, you will use "System.Drawing.Common" as a dependency on your windows system for .Net6 (or gerter) project. In this configuration, the result of the drawing is closer to .netcore31 or before.

- Set the "Target OS" to "None" or other options for your project, you will use "SkiaSharp" as a dependency on your windows system for .Net6 (or gerter) project. *Please note the version that uses "SkiaSharp" as a dependency doesn't support printing to printer feature.*

### Install through msi or DLL

1. [Download Aspose.Cells.msi or DLL](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/)

2. Open the installation directory or the DLL directory, then select step 3 or 4 below:

3. locate the "net6.0-windows" subdirectory, add the Aspose.Cells.dll in it to your .net6 application. Manually add the following nuget packages to your .net6 project:
- System.Drawing.Common, 6.0.0.
- System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs, 6.0.5.
- System.Text.Encoding.CodePages, 4.7.0.

In this way, you will use "System.Drawing.Common" as a dependency on your windows system for .Net6 (or gerter) project. In this configuration, the result of the drawing is closer to .netcore31 or before.

4. locate the "net6.0" subdirectory, add the Aspose.Cells.dll in it to your .net6 application. Manually add the following nuget packages to your .net6 project:
- SkiaSharp, 3.116.1.
- System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs, 6.0.5.
- System.Text.Encoding.CodePages, 4.7.0.

In this way, you will use "SkiaSharp" as a dependency on your windows system for .Net6 (or gerter) project. *Please note the version that uses "SkiaSharp" as a dependency doesn't support printing to printer feature.*

## Run Aspose.Cells for .Net6 (or gerter) on Linux

Refer to the installation method on Windows, you can only select SkiaSharp as a graphics library dependency on Linux system.

You need to do the following additional operations to ensure proper use of SkiaSharp under Linux:

1. Run the following command in your Linux System:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libfontconfig1
```
OR
```
apk update && apk add fontconfig 
```

2. Add the nuget package "SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux 3.116.1" to your .net6 (or gerter) project.
3. Or you can choose to add the nuget packages "SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies 3.116.1" to your .net6 (or gerter) project, instead of the two steps above.

*Please note, the version of the added package "SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux" or "SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies" should be corresponding to the version of "SkiaSharp" referenced by Aspose.Cells for .NET. The versions of Aspose.Cells for .NET and the corresponding referenced "SKiaSharp" versions are described as following:*

| Aspose.Cells for .NET  |                SkiaSharp                |
| :--------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| >= 22.10.1 && <= 22.11 |                 2.88.0                  |
|  >= 22.12 && <= 23.9   |                 2.88.3                  |
|  >= 23.10 && <= 24.12  |                 2.88.6                  |
|        = 25.1.1        |                 3.116.1                 |
|        >=25.1.2        | 2.88.9(net6.0, net8.0), 3.116.1(net9.0) |
