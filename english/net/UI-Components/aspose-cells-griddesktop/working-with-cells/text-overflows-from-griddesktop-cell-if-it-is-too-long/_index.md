## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Microsoft Excel overflows the text when the next adjacent cells are empty and the text is too long to fit inside the cell. Aspose.Cells for GridDesktop also supports this feature. However, this feature was not supported in earlier versions of GridDesktop e.g. 17.11, 17.10 etc. The newer versions starting from 17.12 and onward supports this feature.
