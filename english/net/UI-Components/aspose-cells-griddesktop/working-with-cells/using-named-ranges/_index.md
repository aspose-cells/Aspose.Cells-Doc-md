Normally, you use the labels of columns and rows on a worksheet to refer to the cells within those columns and rows. But you can create descriptive names to represent cells, ranges of cells, formulas, or constant values. The word **Name** may refer to a string of characters that represents a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value. For example, Use easy-to-understand names, such as Products, to refer to hard to understand ranges, such as Sales!C20:C30 to represent a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value. Labels can be used in formulas that refer to data on the same worksheet; if you want to represent a range on another worksheet, you may use a name. **Named Ranges** are among the most powerful features of Microsoft. Users may assign a name to a named range so that this range of cells can be referred with its name in the formulas. **Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop** does support this feature.
