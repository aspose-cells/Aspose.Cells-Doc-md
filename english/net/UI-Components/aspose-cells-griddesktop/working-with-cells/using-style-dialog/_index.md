Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop is a GUI‑based control that lets its users work on their data in a WYSIWYG mode. We have explored the API of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop extensively to perform different kinds of tasks. We have also discussed controlling the formatting settings of Grid, Worksheets, Rows & Columns, and Cells programmatically using the robust and easy API of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop. However, all of that was from the programming point of view. In this topic, we will discuss how a simple end user can control the formatting settings of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop using its **Style Dialog**.

## **Using Style Dialog**
To use **Style Dialog** in Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop, please follow the steps below:

- **Right Click** on the Grid. A context menu will be popped up before offering you some options.
- Select **Format Cells...** option from the context menu.

After you select **Format Cells...** option, **Style Dialog** will appear. **Style Dialog** consists of several tabs, including: **Number**, **Alignment**, **Border**, **Font**, and **Protection**.

Let's discuss and view each tab of the **Style Dialog** one by one.
### **Number Tab**
The **Number** tab is used to set the **Number Format** settings of a cell. You can select a number format category, set decimal places for the value, select a symbol set, and also select how to show negative values in the cell.
### **Alignment Tab**
Using the **Alignment** tab, users can set the horizontal and vertical alignment of the text. They can also use other text‑controlling options such as wrapping text, shrinking the cell to fit text, and merging cells.
### **Border Tab**
The **Border** tab facilitates users to draw borders of any type and color with just a few clicks. All they have to do is select a few options to draw a border according to their desires.
### **Font Tab**
Using the **Font** tab, users can change their font name, size, color, and style, etc. Users can also preview their font settings before applying them on cells, making the job of formatting cells **just in time** easier.
### **Protection Tab**
The **Protection** tab simply allows users to protect their cells by locking or hiding them.

Developers can also open **Style Dialog** programmatically by calling the **ShowStyleDialog** method of **GridDesktop**.
