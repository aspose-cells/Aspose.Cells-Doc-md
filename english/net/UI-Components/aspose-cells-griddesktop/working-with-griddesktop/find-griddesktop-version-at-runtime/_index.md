For example, you may want to ensure that you are using the correct version, or you may be debugging your application and need to know which version of GridDesktop is currently in use. GridDesktop provides the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.GridDesktop.GetVersion() method, which returns the GridDesktop version at runtime.
