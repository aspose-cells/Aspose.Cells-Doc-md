   The **Create a New Project** dialog is opened.

### **Step 3: Add controls to the form**
1. Drag **GridDesktop** and **FormulaBar** controls to the form. This should add the reference to the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.dll in the project references. If the reference is not added, you can manually add it by right‑clicking the References node and selecting **Add Reference...**. Browse to the location of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.dll and add it.

2. Once the controls are added, set the **Name** of the GridDesktop control in the **Properties** tab. (This is required for linking the FormulaBar to the GridDesktop.)
