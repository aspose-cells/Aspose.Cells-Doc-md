This topic discusses setting the column width and row height using the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop API. Sometimes, worksheet cells contain values that are wider than the original cell. It makes it difficult for users to read the cell content. Some users don't like to use the right arrow key to view the complete value in a cell. To solve such problems, developers can change the column width. Changing the row height solves similar issues.
