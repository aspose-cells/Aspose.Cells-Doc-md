{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

The following is a list of features that are not currently supported by Aspose.Cells for JasperReports:

- **No automatic installer**. Aspose.Cells for JasperReports is distributed as a ZIP archive. [To install](/cells/jasperreports/installation/), extract and copy files into the appropriate location and possibly edit some XML configuration files. An automatic installer will be provided in the future.
- **Excel doesn't support all JasperReports chart types**. Some types of charts in JasperReports are incompatible with Microsoft Excel charts, for example: XYBarChart, XYAreaChart, ThermometerChart, CandlestickChart, HighLowChart, MultipleAxisChart and MeterChart. These charts are exported as images, the same way the original JasperReports XLS exporter manages charts. (Other charts are exported as editable charts.)
