## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells supports the creation of a named range. There are different ways to create a named range. One of the simplest ways is to first create [IRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_range) object and then set its name using [IRange.SetName()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_range#a78480b6b6db0f24cffc8acc2b06552eb) method. You can see all the named ranges inside your excel file via Microsoft Excel *Name Manager* interface.
## **Create Named Range in a Workbook**
The following sample code explains how to create a *Named Range* via Aspose.Cells. Once, the *Named Range* is created, it is visible inside the [IWorkbook.GetIWorksheets().GetINames()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_worksheet_collection#aa9e7bc07917a152a2c0de161cca133fa) collection. Please see the [output excel file](23167006.xlsx) generated by the code for a reference.

## **Console Output**
The following console output prints the values of [GetFullText](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/class/aspose.cells.i_name#a5b450ef193365dec035c58280fbe9563) and `GetRefersTo` methods of the created *Named Range* in the above code.
