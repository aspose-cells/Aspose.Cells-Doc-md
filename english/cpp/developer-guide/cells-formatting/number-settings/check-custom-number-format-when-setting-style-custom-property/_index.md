## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

If you assign an invalid custom number format to [**Style.Custom**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/style/custom/) property, then Aspose.Cells will not throw any exception. But if you want that Aspose.Cells should check if the assigned custom number format is valid or not, then please set the [**Workbook.Settings.CheckCustomNumberFormat**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/checkcustomnumberformat/) property to **true**.

## **Check Custom Number Format when setting Style.Custom property**

The following sample code assigns an invalid custom number format to [**Style.Custom**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/style/custom/) property. Since we have already set [**Workbook.Settings.CheckCustomNumberFormat**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/checkcustomnumberformat/) property to **true**, therefore it throws an exception, e.g., Invalid number format. Please read the comments inside the code for more help.

## **Sample Code**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C

    // Create an instance of Workbook class
    Workbook book;

    // Setting this property to true will make Aspose.Cells to throw exception
    // when invalid custom number format is assigned to Style.Custom property
    book.GetSettings().SetCheckCustomNumberFormat(true);

    // Access first worksheet
    Worksheet sheet = book.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Access cell A1 and put some number to it
    Cell cell = sheet.GetCells().Get(u"A1");
    cell.PutValue(2347);

    // Access cell's style and set its Style.Custom property
    Style style = cell.GetStyle();

    // This line will throw exception if Workbook.Settings.CheckCustomNumberFormat is set to true
    style.SetCustom(u"ggg @ fff"); // Invalid custom number format

    std::cout << "Custom number format set." << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
