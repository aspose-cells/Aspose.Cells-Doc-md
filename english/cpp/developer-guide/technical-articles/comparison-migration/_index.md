## **Migrating Excel Files**

Migrating Excel files involves converting them from one format to another or updating them to a newer version. Aspose.Cells for C++ simplifies this process.

1. Load the Excel file using the [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/) class.
2. Use the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/save/) method to save the file in the desired format.


### **Handling Differences**

When comparing or migrating Excel files, you may encounter differences in data, formulas, or formatting. Aspose.Cells for C++ provides various methods to handle these differences effectively.

- Use the [GetFormula](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/getformula/) method to retrieve and compare formulas.
- Use the [Calculate](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/abstractcalculationengine/calculate/) method to recalculate formulas if needed.
- Use the [Column](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/column/) class to manage column-specific differences.


### **Conclusion**

Aspose.Cells for C++ provides comprehensive tools for comparing and migrating Excel files. By leveraging these tools, you can ensure data integrity and streamline the migration process.
