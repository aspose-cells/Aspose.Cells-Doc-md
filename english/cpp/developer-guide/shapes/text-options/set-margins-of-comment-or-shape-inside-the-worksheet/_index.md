description: Learn how to set margins of comments or shapes inside a worksheet using Aspose.Cells with C++.  
---  

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [**Shape.GetTextAlignment()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/fontsettingcollection/gettextalignment/) property. This property returns the object of [**Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Texts.ShapeTextAlignment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class which has different properties e.g. [**GetTopMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/gettopmarginpt/), [**GetLeftMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getleftmarginpt/), [**GetBottomMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getbottommarginpt/), [**GetRightMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getrightmarginpt/), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom, and right margins.  

## **Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet**  

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](61767851.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom, and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](61767852.xlsx) generated by the code and a screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.

## **Sample Code**  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C

    // Load the sample Excel file
    Workbook workbook(u"sampleSetMarginsOfCommentOrShapeInsideTheWorksheet.xlsx");

    // Access first worksheet
    Worksheet ws = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Iterate through each shape in the worksheet
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < ws.GetShapes().GetCount(); i++)
    {
        Shape sh = ws.GetShapes().Get(i);

        // Access the text alignment
        ShapeTextAlignment txtAlign = sh.GetTextBody().GetTextAlignment();

        // Set auto margin false
        txtAlign.SetIsAutoMargin(false);

        // Set the top, left, bottom and right margins
        txtAlign.SetTopMarginPt(10);
        txtAlign.SetLeftMarginPt(10);
        txtAlign.SetBottomMarginPt(10);
        txtAlign.SetRightMarginPt(10);
    }

    // Save the output Excel file
    workbook.Save(u"outputSetMarginsOfCommentOrShapeInsideTheWorksheet.xlsx");

    std::cout << "Margins set successfully!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
