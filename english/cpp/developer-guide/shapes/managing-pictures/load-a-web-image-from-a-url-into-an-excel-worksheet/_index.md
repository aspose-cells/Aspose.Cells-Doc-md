## Load an Image from a URL into an Excel Worksheet

Aspose.Cells for C++ API provides a straightforward method to load images from URLs into Excel Worksheets. This article explains how to download image data into a memory stream and insert it into the worksheet using Aspose.Cells. The image becomes embedded in the Excel file and doesn't require external downloads when opened.

## Sample Code

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <Aspose.Cells.h>
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Source and output directories
    U16String srcDir(u"../Data/01_SourceDirectory/");
    U16String outDir(u"../Data/02_OutputDirectory/");

    try
    {
        // Create a new workbook
        Workbook wb;

        // Get the first worksheet
        WorksheetCollection worksheets = wb.GetWorksheets();
        Worksheet sheet = worksheets.Get(0);

        // Get the pictures collection
        PictureCollection pictures = sheet.GetPictures();

        // Insert the picture from local file to B2 cell (row 1, column 1)
        // Note: Image file should be pre-downloaded to source directory
        U16String imagePath = srcDir + u"aspose-logo.jpg";
        pictures.Add(1, 1, imagePath);

        // Save the Excel file
        wb.Save(outDir + u"webimagebook.out.xlsx");
        std::cout << "Image added successfully." << std::endl;
    }
    catch (const std::exception& ex)
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << ex.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

For scenarios requiring always-updated images from a URL, use the method described in [Insert a Linked Picture from Web Address](/cells/cpp/insert-a-linked-picture-from-web-address/). This approach loads the image from the URL each time the worksheet is opened.
