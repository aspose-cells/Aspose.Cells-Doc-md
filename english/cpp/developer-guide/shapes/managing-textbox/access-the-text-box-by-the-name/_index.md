## Access the Text Box by the Name

Earlier, text boxes were accessed by index from the [**Worksheet.GetTextBoxes()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/gettextboxes/) collection, but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.

The following sample code first creates a text box and assigns it some text and a name. Then, in the next lines, we access the same text box by its name and print its text.

### C++ code to access the text box by name

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"

using namespace Aspose::Cells;
using namespace Aspose::Cells::Drawing;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Create an object of the Workbook class
    Workbook workbook;

    // Access first worksheet from the collection
    Worksheet sheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Add the TextBox to the worksheet
    int idx = sheet.GetTextBoxes().Add(10, 10, 10, 10);

    // Access newly created TextBox using its index & name it
    TextBox tb1 = sheet.GetTextBoxes().Get(idx);
    tb1.SetName(u"MyTextBox");

    // Set text for the TextBox
    tb1.SetText(u"This is MyTextBox");

    // Access the same TextBox via its name
    TextBox tb2 = sheet.GetTextBoxes().Get(u"MyTextBox");

    // Display the text of the TextBox accessed via name
    std::cout << tb2.GetText().ToUtf8() << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Press any key to continue..." << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```

### Console output generated by the sample code

Here is the console output of the above sample code.

{{< highlight java >}}

This is MyTextBox
