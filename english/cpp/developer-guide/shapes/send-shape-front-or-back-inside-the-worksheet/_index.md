## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location, their visibility is determined by their z‑order positions. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/tofrontorback/) method, which changes the z‑order position of the shape. If you want to send a shape to the back, you use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. If you want to bring a shape to the front, you use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.  

## **Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**  

The following sample code demonstrates the usage of the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/tofrontorback/) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528330.xlsx) used in the code and the [output Excel file](50528331.xlsx) generated by it. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file upon execution.

## **Sample Code**  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Source directory path
    U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");

    // Output directory path
    U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");

    // Load source Excel file
    Workbook wb(srcDir + u"sampleToFrontOrBack.xlsx");

    // Access first worksheet
    Worksheet ws = wb.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Access first and fourth shape
    Shape sh1 = ws.GetShapes().Get(0);
    Shape sh4 = ws.GetShapes().Get(3);

    // Print the Z‑Order position of the shape
    std::cout << "Z‑Order Shape 1: " << sh1.GetZOrderPosition() << std::endl;

    // Send this shape to the front
    sh1.ToFrontOrBack(2);

    // Print the Z‑Order position of the shape
    std::cout << "Z‑Order Shape 4: " << sh4.GetZOrderPosition() << std::endl;

    // Send this shape to the back
    sh4.ToFrontOrBack(-2);

    // Save the output Excel file
    wb.Save(outDir + u"outputToFrontOrBack.xlsx");

    std::cout << "Shapes reordered successfully!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
