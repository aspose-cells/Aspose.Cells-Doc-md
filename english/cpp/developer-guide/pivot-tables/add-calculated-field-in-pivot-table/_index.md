## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When you create a pivot table based on known data, you find that the data in it is not what you want. The data you want is the combination of these original data. For example, you need to add, subtract, multiply and divide the original data before you want the data. At this time, you need to build a calculated field and set the corresponding formula for calculation. Then perform some statistics and other operations on the calculated field. 

## **Add calculated field in Pivot Table in Excel**
Insert a calculated field in a PivotTable in Excel, follow these steps:

1. Select the PivotTable that you want to add a calculated field to. 
2. Go to the PivotTable Analyze tab on the ribbon.
3. Click on "Fields, Items, & Sets" and then select "Calculated Field" from the drop-down menu.
4. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the calculated field.
5. In the "Formula" field, enter the formula for the calculation you want to perform using the appropriate PivotTable field names and mathematical operators.

6. Click "ok" to create the calculated field.
7. The new calculated field will appear in the PivotTable Field List under the Values section.
8. Drag the calculated field to the Values section of the PivotTable to display the calculated values.

## **Add calculated field in Pivot Table Using C++**
Add calculated field to Excel file using Aspose.Cells. Please see the following sample code. After executing the example code, a pivot table with calculated field is added to the worksheet.
1. Set the original data and create a pivot table. 
2. Create the calculated field according to the existing PivotField in the pivot table.
3. Add the calculated field to the data area. 
4. Finally, it saves the workbook in [output XLSX](out.xlsx) format. 

## **Sample Code**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Creating a Workbook object
    Workbook workbook;

    // Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet
    Worksheet ws = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);
    Cells cells = ws.GetCells();

    // Setting the values to the cells
    Cell cell = cells.Get("A1");
    cell.PutValue(u"Fruit");

    cell = cells.Get("B1");
    cell.PutValue(u"Count");

    cell = cells.Get("C1");
    cell.PutValue(u"Price");

    cell = cells.Get("A2");
    cell.PutValue(u"Apple");

    cell = cells.Get("A3");
    cell.PutValue(u"Mango");

    cell = cells.Get("A4");
    cell.PutValue(u"Blackberry");

    cell = cells.Get("A5");
    cell.PutValue(u"Cherry");

    cell = cells.Get("B2");
    cell.PutValue(5);

    cell = cells.Get("B3");
    cell.PutValue(3);

    cell = cells.Get("B4");
    cell.PutValue(6);

    cell = cells.Get("B5");
    cell.PutValue(4);

    cell = cells.Get("C2");
    cell.PutValue(5);

    cell = cells.Get("C3");
    cell.PutValue(20);

    cell = cells.Get("C4");
    cell.PutValue(30);

    cell = cells.Get("C5");
    cell.PutValue(60);

    // Adding a PivotTable to the worksheet
    int32_t i = ws.GetPivotTables().Add(u"=A1:C5", u"D10", u"PivotTable1");

    // Accessing the instance of the newly added PivotTable
    PivotTable pivotTable = ws.GetPivotTables().Get(i);
    pivotTable.AddFieldToArea(PivotFieldType::Row, 0);

    // Adding a calculated field to PivotTable and dragging it to data area
    pivotTable.AddCalculatedField(u"total", u"=Count*Price", true);

    pivotTable.RefreshData();
    pivotTable.CalculateData();

    workbook.Save(u"out.xlsx");

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
