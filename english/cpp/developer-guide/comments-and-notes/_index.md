## **Introduction**

Comments are used to add additional information to cells. Aspose.Cells provides two methods for adding comments to cells. The first is to create comments in a designer file manually. These comments are then imported using Aspose.Cells. The second is to add comments using the Aspose.Cells API at runtime. This topic discusses adding comments to cells using the Aspose.Cells API. Formatting comments will also be explained.

## **Adding a Comment**

Add a comment to a cell by calling the [**Comments**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/commentcollection/) collection's [**Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/commentcollection/add/) method (encapsulated in the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/) object). The new [**Comment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/comment/) object can be accessed from the [**Comments**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/commentcollection/) collection by passing the comment index. After accessing the [**Comment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/comment/) object, customize the comment note by using the [**Comment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/comment/) object's [**GetNote()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/comment/getnote/) property.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Source directory path
    U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");

    // Output directory path
    U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");

    // Create a new workbook
    Workbook workbook;

    // Add a new worksheet to the workbook
    int32_t sheetIndex = workbook.GetWorksheets().Add();

    // Get the reference of the newly added worksheet
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(sheetIndex);

    // Add a comment to cell "F5"
    int32_t commentIndex = worksheet.GetComments().Add(u"F5");

    // Access the newly added comment
    Comment comment = worksheet.GetComments().Get(commentIndex);

    // Set the comment note
    comment.SetNote(u"Hello Aspose!");

    // Save the Excel file
    U16String outputPath = outDir + u"book1.out.xls";
    workbook.Save(outputPath);

    std::cout << "Excel file saved successfully!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```

## **Comment Formatting**

It is also possible to format comments' appearance by configuring their height, width and font settings.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Source directory path
    U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");

    // Output directory path
    U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");

    // Create workbook
    Workbook workbook;

    // Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
    int32_t sheetIndex = workbook.GetWorksheets().Add();

    // Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(sheetIndex);

    // Adding a comment to "F5" cell
    int32_t commentIndex = worksheet.GetComments().Add(u"F5");

    // Accessing the newly added comment
    Comment comment = worksheet.GetComments().Get(commentIndex);

    // Setting the comment note
    comment.SetNote(u"Hello Aspose!");

    // Setting the font size of a comment to 14
    comment.GetFont().SetSize(14);

    // Setting the font of a comment to bold
    comment.GetFont().SetIsBold(true);

    // Setting the height of the font to 10
    comment.SetHeightCM(10);

    // Setting the width of the font to 2
    comment.SetWidthCM(2);

    // Saving the Excel file
    workbook.Save(outDir + u"book1.out.xls");

    std::cout << "Excel file saved successfully!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```

## **Add an Image to Comment**

With Microsoft Excel 2007, it is also possible to have an image as the background to a cell comment. In Excel 2007 this is accomplished by doing the following steps. (They suppose that you have already added a cell comment.)

1. Right-click the cell that contains the comment.
1. Select **Show/Hide Comments**, and clear any text from the comment.
1. Click on the border of the comment to select it.
1. Select **Format**, then **Comment**.
1. On the **Colors and Lines** tab, expand the **Color** list.
1. Click **Fill Effects**.
1. On the **Picture** tab, click **Select Picture**.
1. Locate and select the picture.
1. Click **OK** until all dialogs have closed.

Aspose.Cells also provides this feature. Below is a code sample that creates an XLSX file from scratch, adding a comment to cell "A1" with a picture set as its background.

```c++
#include <Aspose.Cells.h>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    U16String srcDir(u"../Data/01_SourceDirectory/");
    U16String outDir(u"../Data/02_OutputDirectory/");

    Workbook workbook;
    WorksheetCollection worksheets = workbook.GetWorksheets();
    Worksheet sheet = worksheets.Get(0);
    CommentCollection comments = sheet.GetComments();

    int32_t commentIndex = comments.Add(0, 0);
    Comment comment = comments.Get(commentIndex);
    comment.SetNote(u"First note.");

    Font commentFont = comment.GetFont();
    commentFont.SetName(u"Times New Roman");

    U16String imagePath = srcDir + u"logo.jpg";
    std::vector<uint8_t> imageData;
    std::ifstream file(imagePath.ToUtf8(), std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate);
    if (file)
    {
        std::streamsize size = file.tellg();
        file.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);
        imageData.resize(size);
        file.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(imageData.data()), size);
    }
    Vector<uint8_t> data(imageData.data(), static_cast<int32_t>(imageData.size()));

    CommentShape shape = comment.GetCommentShape();
    shape.GetFill().SetImageData(data);

    U16String outputPath = outDir + u"book1.out.xlsx";
    workbook.Save(outputPath, SaveFormat::Xlsx);

    std::cout << "Workbook with image comment created successfully." << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```
