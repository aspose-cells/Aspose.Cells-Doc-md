Sometimes, you want to access a worksheet from a chart's reference. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Chart::GetWorksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/getworksheet/) method which returns the reference of the worksheet that contains the chart.

The following example shows how to use the [**Chart::GetWorksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/getworksheet/) method. The code first prints the name of the worksheet, then accesses the first chart on the worksheet. It then prints the worksheet name again, using the [**Chart::GetWorksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/getworksheet/) method.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"

using namespace Aspose::Cells;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // Source directory path
    U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");

    // Create workbook from sample Excel file
    Workbook workbook(srcDir + u"sample.xlsx");

    // Access first worksheet of the workbook
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Print worksheet name
    cout << "Sheet Name: " << worksheet.GetName().ToUtf8() << endl;

    // Access the first chart inside this worksheet
    Chart chart = worksheet.GetCharts().Get(0);

    // Access the chart's sheet and display its name again
    cout << "Chart's Sheet Name: " << chart.GetWorksheet().GetName().ToUtf8() << endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

Below is the console output that the sample code results in. As you can see, it prints the same worksheet name both times.
