Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the chart. For example, the user wants to know whether a secondary value axis exists in the chart. Some charts such as Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have an axis.

Aspose.Cells provides the [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/hasaxis/) method to determine whether the chart has a particular axis.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/hasaxis/) to determine whether the sample chart has primary and secondary category and value axes.

## C++ code to determine which axis exists in the chart

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C

    // Create source directory path
    U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");

    // Create a workbook object
    Workbook workbook(srcDir + u"source.xlsx");

    // Access the first worksheet
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

    // Access the chart
    Chart chart = worksheet.GetCharts().Get(0);

    // Determine which axis exists in the chart
    bool ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Category, true);
    std::wcout << u"Has Primary Category Axis: " << ret << std::endl;

    ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Category, false);
    std::wcout << u"Has Secondary Category Axis: " << ret << std::endl;

    ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Value, true);
    std::wcout << u"Has Primary Value Axis: " << ret << std::endl;

    ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Value, false);
    std::wcout << u"Has Secondary Value Axis: " << ret << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```

## Console output generated by the sample code

The console output of the code is shown below; it displays **true** for the primary category and value axes and **false** for the secondary category and value axes.

{{< highlight java >}}

Has Primary Category Axis: True

Has Secondary Category Axis: False

Has Primary Value Axis: True

Has Secondary Value Axis: False
