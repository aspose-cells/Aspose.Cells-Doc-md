## **Convert Excel Workbook to JSON**  

No need to wonder how to convert an Excel workbook to JSON, because the Aspose.Cells for C++ library provides the best solution. The Aspose.Cells API provides support for converting spreadsheets to JSON format. To export the workbook to JSON, pass [**SaveFormat.Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/saveformat/) as the second parameter of the [**Workbook.Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/save/) method. You may also use the [**JsonSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/jsonsaveoptions/) class to specify additional settings for exporting worksheets to JSON.  

The following code example demonstrates exporting an Excel workbook to JSON. Please see the code that converts the source file ([sample.xlsx](sample.xlsx)) to the JSON file generated by the code for reference.  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C

    // Load your source workbook
    U16String inputFilePath(u"sample.xlsx");
    Workbook workbook(inputFilePath);

    // Convert the workbook to a JSON file.
    U16String outputFilePath(u"sample_out.json");
    workbook.Save(outputFilePath, SaveFormat::Json);

    std::cout << "Workbook converted to JSON successfully!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```  

The following code example, which uses the **JsonSaveOptions** class to specify additional settings, demonstrates exporting an Excel workbook to JSON. Please see the code that converts the source file ([sample.xlsx](sample.xlsx)) to the JSON file generated by the code for reference.  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;

int main()
{
    Aspose::Cells::Startup();

    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C

    // Create options for saving the file.
    JsonSaveOptions options;

    // Set the export range.
    options.SetExportArea(CellArea::CreateCellArea(u"B1", u"C4"));

    // Load your source workbook
    Workbook workbook(u"sample.xlsx");

    // Convert the workbook to a JSON file.
    workbook.Save(u"sample_out.json", options);

    std::cout << "Workbook successfully converted to JSON!" << std::endl;

    Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
