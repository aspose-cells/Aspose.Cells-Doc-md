Use WordArt to add special text or picture effects to spreadsheets. For example, stretch a title across the top of the sheet, decorate text, make text fit a preset shape, or apply it to an Excel sheet as a background watermark. The WordArt becomes an object that you can move or position in spreadsheets to add decoration.
