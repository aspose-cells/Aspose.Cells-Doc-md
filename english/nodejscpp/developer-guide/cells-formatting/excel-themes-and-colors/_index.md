## **How to Apply and Create Color Scheme in Excel**  
Document themes make it easy to coordinate colors, fonts, and graphic formatting effects of Excel documents and update them quickly.  
Themes provide a unified look with named styles, graphical effects, and other objects used in a workbook. For example, the Accent1 style looks different in the Office and the Apex themes. Often, you apply a document theme and then amend it to how you want it.  

### **How to Apply a Color Scheme in Excel**

Aspose.Cells provides features for customizing themes and colors.  

### **How to Create Custom Color Theme in Aspose.Cells**  
If theme colors are used in the file, we don't need to modify each cell individually; we just need to modify the colors in the theme.  

The following example shows how to apply custom themes with your desired colors. We use a sample template file manually created in Microsoft Excel 2007.  

The following example loads a template XLSX file, defines colors for different theme color types, applies the custom colors, and saves the Excel file.
