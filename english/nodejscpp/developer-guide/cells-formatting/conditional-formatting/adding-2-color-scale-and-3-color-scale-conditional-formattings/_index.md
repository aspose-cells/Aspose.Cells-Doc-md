**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they are differed by [**ColorScale.setIs3ColorScale(boolean)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/colorscale/#setIs3ColorScale-boolean-) method. This method is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
