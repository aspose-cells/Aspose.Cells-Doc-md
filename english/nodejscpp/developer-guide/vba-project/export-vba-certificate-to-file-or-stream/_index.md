## **Export VBA Certificate to File or Stream in Node.js**

Please see the following sample code that saves the raw data of the VBA Certificate into a file. You can download the [sample excel file used in this code](5115031.xlsm) from the provided link.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Load your source excel file into workbook object
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "sampleVBAProjectSigned.xlsm"));

// Retrieve bytes data of Digital Certificate of VBA Project
const certBytes = workbook.getVbaProject().getCertRawData();

// Save Certificate Data into FileStream
require("fs").writeFileSync(path.join(dataDir, "Cert_out_"), Uint8Array.from(certBytes));
```
