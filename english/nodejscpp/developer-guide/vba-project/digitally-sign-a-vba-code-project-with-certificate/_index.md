{{% alert color="primary" %}}

You can digitally sign your VBA code project using Aspose.Cells with its [**VbaProject.sign(DigitalSignature)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/vbaproject/#sign-digitalsignature-) method. Please follow these steps to check if your Excel file is digitally signed with a certificate.

- Click **Visual Basic** from the **Developer** tab to open **Visual Basic for Applications IDE**
- Click **Tools** > **Digital Signatures...** of **Visual Basic for Applications IDE**

and it will show the **Digital Signature Form** showing if the document is digitally signed with a certificate or not.

## **Digitally Sign a VBA Code Project with Certificate in Node.js**

The following sample code illustrates how to make use of [**VbaProject.sign(DigitalSignature)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/vbaproject/#sign-digitalsignature-) method. Here are the input and output files of the sample code. You can use any Excel file and any certificate to test this code.

- [Source Excel file](5115028.xlsm) used in the sample code.
- [Sample pfx file](5115039.pfx) to create Digital Signature. Please install it on your computer to run this code. Its password is 1234.
- [Output Excel file](5115029.xlsm) generated by the sample code.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// Set up paths
const sourceDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, "output");
const pfxPath = path.join(sourceDir, "sampleDigitallySignVbaProjectWithCertificate.pfx");
const workbookPath = path.join(sourceDir, "sampleDigitallySignVbaProjectWithCertificate.xlsm");

// Set Digital Signature
const password = "1234";
const comment = "Signing Digital Signature using Aspose.Cells";
const digitalSignature = new AsposeCells.DigitalSignature(fs.readFileSync(pfxPath), password, comment, new Date());

// Create workbook object from excel file
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(workbookPath);

// Sign VBA Code Project with Digital Signature
workbook.getVbaProject().sign(digitalSignature);

// Save the workbook
workbook.save(path.join(outputDir, "outputDigitallySignVbaProjectWithCertificate.xlsm"));
```
