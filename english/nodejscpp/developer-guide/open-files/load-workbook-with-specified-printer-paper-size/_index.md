You can specify the printer paper size of your choice while loading your workbook using the [**LoadOptions.setPaperSize(PaperSizeType)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/loadoptions/#setPaperSize-papersizetype-) method. Please note that if you create a new file in MS Excel, you will find that the paper size is the same as the setting of the default printer on your machine.

The following sample code illustrates the usage of [**LoadOptions.setPaperSize(PaperSizeType)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/loadoptions/#setPaperSize-papersizetype-) method. It first creates a workbook, then saves it to a memory stream in XLSX format. Next, it loads the workbook with A5 paper size and saves it in PDF format. Then it loads the workbook again with A3 paper size and saves it again in PDF format. If you open the output PDFs and check their paper size, you will see they are different—one is A5 and the other is A3. Please download the [A5 output PDF](5115234.pdf) and [A3 output PDF](5115233.pdf) generated by the code for your reference.  

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Create a sample workbook and add some data inside the first worksheet
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook();
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
worksheet.getCells().get("P30").putValue("This is sample data.");

// Save the workbook in memory stream
const ms = workbook.saveToStream();

// Now load the workbook from memory stream with A5 paper size
const opts = new AsposeCells.LoadOptions(AsposeCells.LoadFormat.Xlsx);
opts.setPaperSize(AsposeCells.PaperSizeType.PaperA5);
let workbookA5 = new AsposeCells.Workbook(ms, opts);

// Save the workbook in PDF format
workbookA5.save(path.join(dataDir, "LoadWorkbookWithPrinterSize-a5_out.pdf"));

// Now load the workbook again from memory stream with A3 paper size
ms.position = 0;
opts.setPaperSize(AsposeCells.PaperSizeType.PaperA3);
let workbookA3 = new AsposeCells.Workbook(ms, opts);

// Save the workbook in PDF format
workbookA3.save(path.join(dataDir, "LoadWorkbookWithPrinterSize-a3_out.pdf"));
```
