Sometimes you need to insert a picture from the web (http://) into a worksheet. To do so, specify the pictureâ€™s URL and the picture will be downloaded every time the spreadsheet is opened in Excel. The image is not physically embedded into the Excel document, but points to a web resource.  
{{% /alert %}}  

## **Using Microsoft Excel**  

In Microsoft Excel (for example 2007):  

1. Click the **Insert** menu and select **Picture**.  
1. Specify the web address for the picture in the Insert Picture dialog.  

## **Using Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++**  

Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ supports adding a linked image using the [**ShapeCollection.addLinkedPicture(upperLeftRow, upperLeftColumn, heightPixels, widthPixels, sourceFullName)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/shapecollection/#addLinkedPicture-number-number-number-number-string-). The method returns a [**Picture**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/picture) object.  

The following example shows how to add a linked picture from a web address to a worksheet.  

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
// Instantiate a new Workbook.
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook();
// Insert a linked picture (from Web Address) to B2 Cell.
const pic = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getShapes().addLinkedPicture(1, 1, 100, 100, "http://www.aspose.com/Images/aspose-logo.jpg");
// Set the height and width of the inserted image.
pic.setHeightInch(1.04);
pic.setWidthInch(2.6);
// Save the Excel file.
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "outLinkedPicture.out.xlsx"));
```
