## Access the Text Box by the Name

Earlier, text boxes were accessed by index from the [**Worksheet.getTextBoxes()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/worksheet/#getTextBoxes--) collection, but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.

The following sample code first creates a text box and assigns it some text and name. Then in the next lines, we access the same text box by its name and print its text.

### Node.js code to access the text box by name

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx");
// Loads the workbook which contains hidden external links
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(filePath);

// Access first worksheet from the collection
const sheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Add the TextBox to the worksheet
const idx = sheet.getTextBoxes().add(10, 10, 10, 10);

// Access newly created TextBox using its index & name it
const tb1 = sheet.getTextBoxes().get(idx);
tb1.setName("MyTextBox");

// Set text for the TextBox
tb1.setText("This is MyTextBox");

// Access the same TextBox via its name
const tb2 = sheet.getTextBoxes().get("MyTextBox");

// Display the text of the TextBox accessed via name
console.log(tb2.getText());

console.log("Press any key to continue...");
```

### Console output generated by the sample code

Here is the console output of the above sample code.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
This is MyTextBox
{{< /highlight >}}
