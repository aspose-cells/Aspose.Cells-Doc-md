Sometimes, you need to copy elements on a worksheet, for example, pictures, charts and other drawing objects, between worksheets. Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ supports this feature. Charts, images, and other objects can be copied with the highest degree of precision.

This article gives you a detailed understanding of how to copy shapes between worksheets.

## **Copying a Picture from one Worksheet to Another**

To copy a picture from one worksheet to another, use the [**PictureCollection.add(number, number, number, number, Uint8Array)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/picturecollection/#add-number-number-number-number-uint8array-) method as shown in the sample code below.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx");

// Loads the workbook which contains hidden external links
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(filePath);

// Get the Picture from the "Picture" worksheet.
const picturesource = workbook.getWorksheets().get("Picture").getPictures().get(0);

// Save Picture to Memory Stream
const ms = picturesource.getData();

// Copy the picture to the Result Worksheet
workbook.getWorksheets().get("Result").getPictures().add(picturesource.getUpperLeftRow(), picturesource.getUpperLeftColumn(), ms, picturesource.getWidthScale(), picturesource.getHeightScale());

// Save the Worksheet
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "PictureCopied_out.xlsx"));
```

## **Copy a Chart from one Worksheet to Another**

The following code demonstrates the use of [**ShapeCollection.addCopy(Shape, number, number, number, number)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/shapecollection/#addCopy-shape-number-number-number-number-) method to copy a chart from one worksheet to another.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx");
// Loads the workbook which contains hidden external links
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(filePath);

// Get the Chart from the "Chart" worksheet.
const chartsource = workbook.getWorksheets().get("Chart").getCharts().get(0);
const cshape = chartsource.getChartObject();

// Copy the Chart to the Result Worksheet
workbook.getWorksheets().get("Result").getShapes().addCopy(cshape, 20, 0, 2, 0);

// Save the Worksheet
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "ChartCopied_out.xlsx"));
```

## **Copy Controls and Other Drawing Objects from One Worksheet to Another**

To copy controls and other drawing objects, use the [**ShapeCollection.addCopy(Shape, number, number, number, number)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/shapecollection/#addCopy-shape-number-number-number-number-) method as shown in the example below.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample2.xlsx");
// Open the template file
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(filePath);

// Get the Shapes from the "Control" worksheet.
const shape = workbook.getWorksheets().get("Control").getShapes();

// Copy the Textbox to the Result Worksheet
workbook.getWorksheets().get("Result").getShapes().addCopy(shape.get(0), 5, 0, 2, 0);

// Copy the Oval Shape to the Result Worksheet
workbook.getWorksheets().get("Result").getShapes().addCopy(shape.get(1), 10, 0, 2, 0);

// Save the Worksheet
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "ControlsCopied_out.xlsx"));
```
