## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  
Sometimes, you want to auto-populate smart marker data to other worksheets if it is too large. Suppose your data source has 1,500,000 records. These are too many records for a single worksheet, then you can move the rest of the records to the next worksheet.  

## **Auto-Populate Smart Marker Data to Other Worksheets if Data is too Large**  
The following sample code has a data source that has 21 records. We want to show only 15 records in one worksheet, then the rest of the records will automatically move to the second worksheet. Please note, the second worksheet should also have the same smart marker tag and you must call [WorkbookDesigner.process(sheetIndex, isPreserved)](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/workbookdesigner/#process-number-boolean-) method for both sheets. Please see the [output Excel file](60489775.xlsx) generated by the code for reference.  

## **Sample Code**  
```javascript
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");
const path = require("path");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const outputFilePath = path.join(dataDir, "outputAutoPopulateSmartMarkerDataToOtherWorksheets.xlsx");

// Create employees data array
const employees = [];
for (let i = 1230; i <= 1250; i++) {
    employees.push({ EmployeeID: i });
}

// Create empty workbook
const wb = new AsposeCells.Workbook();

// Access first worksheet and add smart marker in cell A1
let ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
ws.getCells().get("A1").putValue("&=Employees.EmployeeID");

// Add second worksheet and add smart marker in cell A1
wb.getWorksheets().add();
ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(1);
ws.getCells().get("A1").putValue("&=Employees.EmployeeID");

// Create workbook designer
const wd = new AsposeCells.WorkbookDesigner(wb);

// Set data source with data array (using a custom method)
wd.setDataSource("Employees", employees, 15);

// Process smart marker tags in first and second worksheet
wd.process(0, false);
wd.process(1, false);

// Save the workbook
wb.save(outputFilePath);
```
