## **Setting Formula for Named Range**
Like the Excel application, Aspose.Cells APIs provide the ability to specify a formula for a named range while using its [RefersTo](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/range/#RefersTo-string-) property. There could be numerous usability scenarios for this feature, a few of which are detailed as follows.

### **Setting a Simple Formula for Named Range**
A simple formula could be a reference to another cell in the same (or different) worksheet. The following example creates a named range in a new spreadsheet and sets its reference to another cell.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Create an instance of Workbook
const book = new AsposeCells.Workbook();

// Get the WorksheetCollection
const worksheets = book.getWorksheets();

// Add a new Named Range with name "NewNamedRange"
const index = worksheets.getNames().add("NewNamedRange");

// Access the newly created Named Range
const name = worksheets.getNames().get(index);

// Set RefersTo property of the Named Range to a formula. Formula references another cell in the same worksheet
name.setRefersTo("=Sheet1!$A$3");

// Set the formula in the cell A1 to the newly created Named Range
worksheets.get(0).getCells().get("A1").setFormula("NewNamedRange");

// Insert the value in cell A3 which is being referenced in the Named Range
worksheets.get(0).getCells().get("A3").putValue("This is the value of A3");

// Calculate formulas
book.calculateFormula();

// Save the result in XLSX format
book.save(path.join(dataDir, "output_out.xlsx"));
```

### **Setting a Complex Formula for Named Range**
A complex formula could be anything such as a dynamic range or a formula spanning over multiple cells in different worksheets. The following example creates a dynamic range using the INDEX function to get the value from a list based on its location.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx");
// Loads the workbook which contains hidden external links
const book = new AsposeCells.Workbook();

// Get the WorksheetCollection
const worksheets = book.getWorksheets();

// Add a new Named Range with name "data"
let index = worksheets.getNames().getCount();
worksheets.getNames().add("data");

// Access the newly created Named Range from the collection
const data = worksheets.getNames().get(index);

// Set RefersTo property of the Named Range to a cell range in same worksheet
data.setRefersTo("=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$10");

// Add another Named Range with name "range"
index = worksheets.getNames().getCount();
worksheets.getNames().add("range");

// Access the newly created Named Range from the collection
const range = worksheets.getNames().get(index);

// Set RefersTo property to a formula using the Named Range data
range.setRefersTo("=INDEX(data,Sheet1!$A$1,1):INDEX(data,Sheet1!$A$1,9)");

// Save the workbook
book.save(path.join(dataDir, "output_out.xlsx"));
```

Here is another example that uses a named range to sum values from 2 cells in different worksheets.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Create an instance of Workbook
const book = new AsposeCells.Workbook();

// Get the WorksheetCollection
const worksheets = book.getWorksheets();

// Insert some data in cell A1 of Sheet1
worksheets.get("Sheet1").getCells().get("A1").putValue(10);

// Add a new Worksheet and insert a value to cell A1
worksheets.get(worksheets.add()).getCells().get("A1").putValue(10);

// Add a new Named Range with name "range"
const index = worksheets.getNames().add("range");

// Access the newly created Named Range from the collection
const range = worksheets.getNames().get(index);

// Set RefersTo property of the Named Range to a SUM function
range.setRefersTo("=SUM(Sheet1!$A$1,Sheet2!$A$1)");

// Insert the Named Range as formula to 3rd worksheet
worksheets.get(worksheets.add()).getCells().get("A1").setFormula("range");

// Calculate formulas
book.calculateFormula();

// Save the result in XLSX format
book.save(path.join(dataDir, "output_out.xlsx"));
```
