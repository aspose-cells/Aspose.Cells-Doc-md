This article explains how to apply a subtotal to data and change the direction of **Outline Summary Rows Below Detail**.

You can apply a subtotal to data using the [**Worksheet.getCells().subtotal()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cells/#subtotal-cellarea-number-consolidationfunction-numberarray-boolean-boolean-boolean-) method. It takes the following parameters.

- **CellArea** – The range to which the subtotal is applied.  
- **GroupBy** – The field to group by, as a zero‑based integer offset.  
- **Function** – The subtotal function.  
- **TotalList** – An array of zero‑based field offsets indicating the fields to which the subtotals are added.  
- **Replace** – Indicates whether to replace the current subtotals.  
- **PageBreaks** – Indicates whether to add a page break between groups.  
- **SummaryBelowData** – Indicates whether to add a summary below the data.

You can also control the direction of **Outline Summary Rows Below Detail**, as shown in the following screenshot, using the `Worksheet.Outline.SummaryRowBelow` property. This setting can be opened in Microsoft Excel via **Data > Outline > Settings**.
