## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can sort data in the column using a custom list. This can be done using the **DataSorter.addKey** method. However, this method works only if the items in the custom list do not have commas inside them. If they have commas, such as "USA,US", "China,CN", etc., then you must use **DataSorter.addKey(number, SortOrder, string[])** method. Here, the last parameter is not a String but an Array of Strings.

## **Sort Data in Column with Custom Sort List**

The following sample code explains how to use the **DataSorter.addKey(number, SortOrder, string[])** method to sort data with a custom sort list. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528327.xlsx) used in this code and the [output Excel file](50528328.xlsx) generated by it. The following screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file when executed.
