Populating a spreadsheet with data first by row and then by column improves the overall performance.

Putting data in the sequence A1, B1, A2, B2 is faster than A1, A2, B1, B2. If there are many cells in a worksheet and you follow the second sequence, that is, you're filling the data row by row, this tip can make the program much faster.
