## **Get Hyperlinks in Range**

The [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/range) class provides a [**getHyperlinks()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/range/#getHyperlinks--) method which returns all the hyperlinks in the selected range. You may also delete the hyperlink by calling the [**Hyperlink.delete()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/hyperlink/#delete--) method.
