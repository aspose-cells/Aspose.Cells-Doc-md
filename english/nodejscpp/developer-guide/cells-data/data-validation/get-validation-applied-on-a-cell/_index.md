You can use Aspose.Cells for Node.js to get the validation applied to a cell. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Cell.getValidation()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cell/#getValidation--) method for this purpose. If there is no validation applied on the cell, it returns null.

Similarly, you can use [**Worksheet.validations.getValidationInCell(number, number)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/validationcollection/#getValidationInCell-number-number-) method to acquire the validation applied to a cell by providing its row and column indices.
