Often you need to know the version number of the application that created a Microsoft Excel document. Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ provides the [**Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.version**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/workbook/#builtInDocumentProperties-version) property for this purpose.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [**Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.version**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/workbook/#builtInDocumentProperties-version) property. It loads Excel files created with Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 and prints the version number of the application that created these Excel documents.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Print the version number of Excel 2003 XLS file
let workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2003.xls"));
console.log("Excel 2003 XLS Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2007 XLS file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2007.xls"));
console.log("Excel 2007 XLS Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2010 XLS file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2010.xls"));
console.log("Excel 2010 XLS Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2013 XLS file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2013.xls"));
console.log("Excel 2013 XLS Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2007 XLSX file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2007.xlsx"));
console.log("Excel 2007 XLSX Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2010 XLSX file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2010.xlsx"));
console.log("Excel 2010 XLSX Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());

// Print the version number of Excel 2013 XLSX file
workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "Excel2013.xlsx"));
console.log("Excel 2013 XLSX Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());
