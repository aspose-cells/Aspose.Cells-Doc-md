## **Draw Slicer while rendering Excel to PDF**
If you have an Excel file **that** has a slicer applied to it and you want to export **the Excel file** to PDF with the slicer settings, Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ now supports this by default. You simply export the Excel file with the slicer to PDF; the generated PDF will show the slicer applied.

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](94044165.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It then saves the workbook as [output PDF file](94044166.pdf). The following screenshot compares the source Excel file and the generated PDF file.
