Normally, named ranges are rectangular with cells continuous and adjacent to each other. But sometimes, you may need to use a non-sequential cell range in which cells are not adjacent. Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ supports creating a named range with non-adjacent cells.

The code sample below shows how to create a named non-sequential range with Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++.


```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");

// Instantiating a Workbook object
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook();

// Adding a Name for non sequenced range
const index = workbook.getWorksheets().getNames().add("NonSequencedRange");

const name = workbook.getWorksheets().getNames().get(index);

// Creating a non sequence range of cells
name.setRefersTo("=Sheet1!$A$1:$B$3,Sheet1!$D$5:$E$6");

// Save the workbook
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "Output.out.xlsx"));
```
