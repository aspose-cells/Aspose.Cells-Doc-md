## **Print Comments while saving to PDF**  

The following sample code illustrates how to use [**PrintCommentsType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/printcommentstype) to print comments while saving to PDF.  

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");

// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
// Create a workbook from the source Excel file
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "SampleWorkbookWithComments.xlsx"));

// Access the first worksheet
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

/*
* For print no comments use "PrintCommentsType.PrintNoComments"
* and for print the comments as displayed on sheet use "PrintCommentsType.PrintInPlace"
* For Print the comments at the end of sheet we use "PrintCommentsType.PrintSheetEnd"
*/
worksheet.getPageSetup().setPrintComments(AsposeCells.PrintCommentsType.PrintSheetEnd);

// Save workbook in pdf format
workbook.save(path.join(dataDir, "PrintCommentWhileSavingToPdf_out.pdf"));
```
