Reusing style objects can save memory and make a program faster.

To apply some formatting to a large range of cells in a worksheet:

1. Create a style object.
1. Specify the attributes.
1. Apply the style to the cells in the range.

Because the [**Cell.GetStyle**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getstyle/)/[**Cell.SetStyle**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setstyle/) approach uses a lot less memory, and is efficient, the older Cell.Style property which consumed a lot of unnecessary memory, was removed with the release of Aspose.Cells 7.1.0.
