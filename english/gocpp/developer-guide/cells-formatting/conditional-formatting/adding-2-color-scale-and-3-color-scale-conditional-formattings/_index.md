**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they are differed by [**FormatCondition.GetIs3ColorScale()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/colorscale/getis3colorscale/) property. This property is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
