## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can change the Language of an Excel file by right-clicking the file and then selecting Properties > Details and then editing the Language field. Please use [**BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.GetLanguage()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/builtindocumentpropertycollection/getlanguage/) property to change it programmatically using Aspose.Cells APIs.

## **Specify the Language of the Excel File using BuiltIn Document Properties**

The following sample code creates a workbook and changes its built-in document property named Language. Please see the [output Excel file](64716891.xlsx) generated by the code and screenshot that shows the modified Language field by [**BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.GetLanguage()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/builtindocumentpropertycollection/getlanguage/) property.
