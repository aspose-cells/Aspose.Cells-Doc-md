## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can change the language of an Excel file by right‑clicking the file, selecting **Properties > Details**, and then editing the Language field. Please use the [**BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.GetLanguage()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/builtindocumentpropertycollection/getlanguage/) property to change it programmatically using Aspose.Cells APIs.

## **Specify the Language of the Excel File using Built-in Document Properties**

The following sample code creates a workbook and changes its built‑in document property named Language. Please see the [output Excel file](64716891.xlsx) generated by the code, as well as the screenshot that shows the modified Language field using the [**BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.GetLanguage()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/builtindocumentpropertycollection/getlanguage/) property.
