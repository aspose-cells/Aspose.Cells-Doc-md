Aspose.Cells allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of a cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell->GetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getcharacters/) and [**Cell->SetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setcharacters/) methods. These methods return and accept an array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/fontsetting/) objects, which you can use to access and update various font properties such as font name, font color, boldness, etc.

## **Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of a Cell**

The following code demonstrates the usage of the [**Cell->GetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getcharacters/) and [**Cell->SetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setcharacters/) methods using the source Excel file (5112369.xlsx). The source Excel file contains rich text in cell A1 with three portions, each having a different font. The code accesses these portions and updates the first portion's font to **Arial**. The modified workbook is saved as the output Excel file (5112366.xlsx).
