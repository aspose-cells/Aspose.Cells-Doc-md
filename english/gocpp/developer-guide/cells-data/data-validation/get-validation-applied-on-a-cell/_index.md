You can use Aspose.Cells to get the validation applied to a cell. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Cell::GetValidation()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getvalidation/) method for this purpose. If there is no validation applied on the cell, it returns null.

Similarly, you can use [**Worksheet::Validations::GetValidationInCell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/validationcollection/getvalidationincell/) method to acquire the validation applied to a cell by providing its row and column indices.
