## **Get Cell Validation in ODS Files**

With Aspose.Cells for C++, you can get the validation applied to a cell in ODS files. The API provides the [**GetValidation**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getvalidation/) method of the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/) class.

The following code sample demonstrates using the [**GetValidation**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getvalidation/) method by loading the [source ODS](101089354.ods) file and reading the validation of cell A9.
