## **Get Hyperlinks in Range**

The [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/) class provides a [**GetHyperlinks()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/gethyperlinks/) property which returns all the hyperlinks in the selected range. You may also delete the Hyperlink by calling the [**Hyperlink.Delete**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/hyperlink/delete/) method.
