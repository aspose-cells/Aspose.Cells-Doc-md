This article explains how to apply subtotal to data and change the direction of outline summary rows below detail.

You can apply subtotal to data using the [**Worksheet.Cells.Subtotal()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cells/subtotal_cellarea_int_consolidationfunction_int32array/) method. It takes the following parameters:

- **CellArea** – The range to which the subtotal is applied
- **GroupBy** – The field to group by, as a zero‑based integer offset
- **Function** – The subtotal function
- **TotalList** – An array of zero‑based field offsets indicating the fields to which the subtotals are added
- **Replace** – Indicates whether to replace the current subtotals
- **PageBreaks** – Indicates whether to add page breaks between groups
- **SummaryBelowData** – Indicates whether to add a summary below the data

You can also control the direction of outline **summary rows below detail** as shown in the following screenshot by using the `Worksheet.Outline.SummaryRowBelow` property. This setting can be opened in Microsoft Excel via **Data > Outline > Settings**.
