Numbers is a spreadsheet application developed by Apple Inc. Aspose.Cells can read a Numbers spreadsheet, but it does not support writing to it. It can read a Numbers spreadsheet's data, style, and formulas.  

## **Read Numbers Spreadsheet Developed by Apple Inc. using Aspose.Cells**  

The following sample code loads the [Sample Numbers Spreadsheet](sampleNumbersByAppleInc.numbers) and converts it to PDF format ([Output PDF](outputNumbersByAppleInc.pdf)). You must use the **[LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/loadoptions/)** class and specify **[LoadFormat::Numbers](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/loadformat/)** as a parameter in its constructor to load it successfully. Please download both files from the given links. You can try the code with any Numbers spreadsheet. Also, please read the comments in the code for more help.
