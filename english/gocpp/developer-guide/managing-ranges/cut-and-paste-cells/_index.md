## **Cut and Paste Cells**

Aspose.Cells provides you with the ability to cut and paste cells within a worksheet by using the [**InsertCutCells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cells/insertcutcells/) method of the [**Cells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cells/) collection. The [**InsertCutCells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cells/insertcutcells/) method accepts the following parameters:

- [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/): The range of cells to be cut.
- Row Index: The index of the row to insert cells.
- Column Index: The index of the column to insert cells.
- [**ShiftType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shifttype/): The shift direction of the columns.

The following example shows how to cut and paste cells within a worksheet.
