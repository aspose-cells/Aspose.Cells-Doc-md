You can use Aspose.Cells to merge or split a range of cells. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Range.Merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/merge/) and [**Range.UnMerge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/range/unmerge/) methods for this purpose. This article explains how to merge a range of cells into a single cell.

## **Example**

The following sample code first creates a range - A1:D4 - then merges the cells in the range into a single cell using the [**Range.Merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/merge/) method. Similarly, you can split cells by creating a range and calling the [**Range.UnMerge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/range/unmerge/) method.
