Sometimes, users need to copy row heights from a source range to a destination range. Aspose.Cells provides the [**PasteType::RowHeights**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/pastetype/) enum for this purpose. When you set the [**GetPasteType()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/pasteoptions/getpastetype/) property with the [**PasteType::RowHeights**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/pastetype/) enum, the heights of all rows inside the source range will be copied to the destination range.

The following sample code explains how to use the [**PasteType::RowHeights**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/pastetype/) enum to copy row heights from a source range to a destination range. When you open the output Excel file generated by this code in Microsoft Excel, you will see that the destination range row heights are exactly the same as the source range row heights.
