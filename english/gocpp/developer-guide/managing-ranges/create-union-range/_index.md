## **Create Union Range**
Aspose.Cells provides the ability to create a **union range** by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method accepts two parameters: the address of the union range and the worksheet index. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method returns a [UnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/unionrange/) object.

The following code snippet demonstrates creating a union range by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The output file generated by the code is attached for reference.
