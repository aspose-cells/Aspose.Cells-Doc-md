## **Create Union Range**
Aspose.Cells provides the ability to create Union Range by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method accepts two parameters, the address to create the union range and the index of the worksheet. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method returns a [UnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/unionrange/) object.

The following code snippet demonstrates creating a Union Range by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The output file generated by the code is attached for reference.
