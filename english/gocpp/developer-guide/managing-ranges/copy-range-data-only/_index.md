Sometimes, you need to copy data from one range of cells to another, copying the data only, not the formatting. Aspose.Cells offers this feature.

This article provides a sample code that uses Aspose.Cells to copy a range of data.

1. Add data to cells in the first worksheet.
1. Create a [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/range/).
1. Create a [**Style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/style/) object with specified formatting attributes.
1. Apply the style formatting to the range.
1. Create another range of cells.
1. Copy data of the first range to this second range.
