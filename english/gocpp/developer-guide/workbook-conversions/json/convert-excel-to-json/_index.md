## **Convert Excel Workbook to JSON**

No need to wonder how to convert an Excel workbook to JSON, because Aspose.Cells for C++ library has the best solution. The Aspose.Cells API provides support for converting spreadsheets to JSON format. To export the workbook to JSON, pass [**SaveFormat.Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/saveformat/) as the second parameter of the [**Workbook.Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/save/) method. You may also use the [**JsonSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/jsonsaveoptions/) class to specify additional settings for exporting a worksheet to JSON.

The following code example demonstrates exporting an Excel workbook to JSON. Please see the code to convert [source file](sample.xlsx) to the JSON file generated by the code for reference.
