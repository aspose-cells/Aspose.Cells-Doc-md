## **Convert Excel Workbook to JSON**

The Aspose.Cells API provides support for converting spreadsheets to JSON format. To export the workbook to JSON, pass [**SaveFormat::Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/saveformat/) as the second parameter of the [**Workbook::Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/save/) method. You may also use the [**JsonSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/jsonsaveoptions/) class to specify additional settings for exporting the worksheet to JSON.

The following code example demonstrates exporting the active worksheet to JSON by using the [**SaveFormat::Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/saveformat/) enumeration member. Please see the code to convert [source file](book1.xlsx) to the [output JSON file](book1.json) generated by the code for reference.
