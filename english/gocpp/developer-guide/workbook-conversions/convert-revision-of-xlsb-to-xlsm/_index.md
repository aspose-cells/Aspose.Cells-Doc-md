Aspose.Cells now supports the full conversion of revisions of XLSB files into XLSM files. Revisions are found inside the path \xl\revisions. You can view them by changing your XLSB file's extension to .zip. The \xl\revisions path contains files ending with .bin extensions.

When you convert your XLSB file into an XLSM file using Aspose.Cells, these .bin files successfully convert to .xml files as shown in these two screenshots.
