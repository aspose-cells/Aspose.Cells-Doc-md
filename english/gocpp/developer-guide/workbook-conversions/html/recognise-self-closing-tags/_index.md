description: Learn how to handle self-closing tags in HTML using Aspose.Cells with Golang via C++.
---

HTML can have a variety of tag formats for empty tags like `<td></td>` or `<td/>`. Aspose.Cells now supports both formats, whereas earlier it only supported `<td></td>`‑like tags. This feature can be tested by converting the attached sample HTML file to an Excel file. The sample HTML file and output Excel file can be downloaded from the following links for testing.
