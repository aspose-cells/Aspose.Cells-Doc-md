--- 

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When you save your Excel file as HTML, comments are not exported. However, Aspose.Cells provides this feature using the [**HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlsaveoptions/isexportcomments/) property. If you set it to **true**, then HTML will also display comments present in your Excel file.

## **Export Comments while Saving Excel file to HTML**

The following sample code demonstrates the usage of the [**HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlsaveoptions/isexportcomments/) property. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the HTML when it is set to **true**. Please download the [sample Excel file](50528260.xlsx) and the [generated HTML](5052826.txt) for reference.
