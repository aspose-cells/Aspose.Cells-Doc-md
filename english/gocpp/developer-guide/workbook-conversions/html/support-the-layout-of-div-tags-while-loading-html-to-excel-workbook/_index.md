Normally, the layout of DIV tags is ignored while loading HTML into an Excel workbook object. However, if you want the layout of DIV tags to be preserved, set the [GetSupportDivTag()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlloadoptions/getsupportdivtag/) property to **true**. The default value of this property is **false**.

The following sample code illustrates the usage of the [GetSupportDivTag()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlloadoptions/getsupportdivtag/) property. Please download the **Aspose logo** (5115218.png) used inside the input HTML and the **output Excel file** (5115220.xlsx) generated by the code.
