When you save your Excel file to HTML, for the scenario that there are multiple occurrences for one base64 image, with custom property the image data only needs to be saved once so the performance of the resultant HTML can be improved. Please use [**HtmlSaveOptions.GetEnableCssCustomProperties()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlsaveoptions/getenablecsscustomproperties/) property and set it to **true** while saving to HTML.
