description: Learn how to enable CSS custom properties while saving Excel files to HTML using Aspose.Cells for C++. Improve performance by reducing redundant image data.

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When you save your Excel file to HTML, in scenarios where the same base64 image occurs multiple times, the custom property allows the image data to be saved only once, improving the performance of the resulting HTML. Please use [**HtmlSaveOptions.GetEnableCssCustomProperties()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/htmlsaveoptions/getenablecsscustomproperties/) and set it to **true** while saving to HTML.
