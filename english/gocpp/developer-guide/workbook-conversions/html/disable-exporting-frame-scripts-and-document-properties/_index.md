Aspose.Cells exports frame scripts and document properties while converting a workbook into HTML. The 8.6.0 version of Aspose.Cells for C++ introduces an option which allows you to optionally disable exporting frame scripts and document properties. Please use the HtmlSaveOptions.ExportFrameScriptsAndProperties property to disable the export.
