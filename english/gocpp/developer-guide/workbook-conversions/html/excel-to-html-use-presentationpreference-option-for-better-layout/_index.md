{{% alert color="primary" %}}  

Aspose.Cells provides a useful HtmlSaveOptions.PresentationPreference property for developers who need to render a better layout when saving a Microsoft Excel file to HTML or MHT format. The default value of the property is false. We recommend setting this property to true to get a more attractive presentation of Excel reports.  

{{% /alert %}}  

Please see the sample code below that demonstrates how to render an HTML file from an Excel report with presentation preference enabled.
