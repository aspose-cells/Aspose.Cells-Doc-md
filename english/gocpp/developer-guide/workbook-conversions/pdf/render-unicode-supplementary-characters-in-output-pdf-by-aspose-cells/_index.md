Normal Unicode characters are 2-bytes long while Unicode Supplementary characters are 4-bytes long. Aspose.Cells now supports rendering of these 4-bytes Unicode characters.

In the Unicode Character Standard, Supplementary Characters are the characters assigned code points from U+10000 to U+10FFFF. In other words, these are the Unicode characters greater than U+FFFF.

- In UTF-8 these characters are each 4 bytes long.
- In UTF-16 these characters require 2 surrogates (16-bit units).
