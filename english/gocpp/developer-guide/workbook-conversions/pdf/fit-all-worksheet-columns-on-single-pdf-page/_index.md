Sometimes you want to generate a PDF file that fits all a worksheet's columns onto one page. The [**PdfSaveOptions.PaginatedSaveOptions(PaginatedSaveOptions_Impl* impl)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/paginatedsaveoptions/~paginatedsaveoptions/) property provides this feature in a very easy-to-use manner. Complex calculations such as the height and width of the output PDF are handled internally and are based on the data in the worksheet.

## **Fit Worksheet Columns on Single PDF Page**

[**PdfSaveOptions.PaginatedSaveOptions(PaginatedSaveOptions_Impl* impl)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/paginatedsaveoptions/~paginatedsaveoptions/) ensures that all columns in a worksheet are rendered to a single PDF page, although rows may expand to several pages depending on the data in the worksheet.

The sample code below shows how to use [**PdfSaveOptions.PaginatedSaveOptions(PaginatedSaveOptions_Impl* impl)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/paginatedsaveoptions/~paginatedsaveoptions/) property to render a large worksheet of 100 columns.

When a given worksheet has many columns, the rendered PDF file may show the content in a very small size. It is still readable when scaled up in a viewing application such as Acrobat Reader.

If your spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call [**Workbook.CalculateFormula()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbook/calculateformula/) just before rendering the spreadsheet to PDF format. Doing so will ensure that the formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
