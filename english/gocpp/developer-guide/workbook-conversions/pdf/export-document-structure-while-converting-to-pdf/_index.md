---  

PDF logical structure facilities provide a mechanism for incorporating information regarding the document content structure into a PDF file. Aspose.Cells preserves information about the structure from a Microsoft Excel document, such as cell, row, table, worksheet, image, shape, header/footer, etc.  

With option [PdfSaveOptions.GetExportDocumentStructure()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/pdfsaveoptions/getexportdocumentstructure/), you can save to a tagged PDF with document structure exported.
