description: Learn how to render solid gridlines while converting Excel to PDF using Aspose.Cells with Go via C++.
---

For compatibility with older versions, Aspose.Cells renders gridlines as dotted lines by default while converting Excel to PDF. However, modern Excel renders gridlines as solid lines.

With the option [PdfSaveOptions.PaginatedSaveOptions(PaginatedSaveOptions_Impl* impl)](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/paginatedsaveoptions/~paginatedsaveoptions/), Aspose.Cells can also render gridlines as solid lines.
