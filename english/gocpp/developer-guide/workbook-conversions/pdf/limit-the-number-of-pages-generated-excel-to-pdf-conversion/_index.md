Sometimes, you want to print a range of pages to an output PDF file. Aspose.Cells has the ability to set a limit on how many pages are generated when converting an Excel spreadsheet to the PDF file format.

## **Limiting the Number of Pages Generated**

The following example shows how to render a range of pages (3 and 4) in a Microsoft Excel file to PDF.

If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call [**Workbook.CalculateFormula()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbook/calculateformula/) just before rendering it to PDF. Doing ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the output file.
