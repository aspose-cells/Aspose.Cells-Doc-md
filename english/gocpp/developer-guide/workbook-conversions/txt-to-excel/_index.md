## **Opening CSV Files**

Comma Separated Values (CSV) files contain records where the values are separated by commas. Data is stored as a table where each column is separated by the comma character and quoted by the double quote character. If a field value contains a double quote character, it is escaped with a pair of double quote characters. You can also use Microsoft Excel to export spreadsheet data to CSV.

## **Opening CSV Files and Replacing Invalid Characters**

In Excel, when a CSV file with special characters is opened, the characters are automatically replaced. The same is done by the Aspose.Cells API, as demonstrated in the code example below.

## **Using Preferred Parser**

It is not always necessary to use default parser settings for opening CSV files. Sometimes, importing a CSV file does not create the expected output, such as when the date format is not as expected or empty fields are handled differently. For this purpose, **TxtLoadOptions.PreferredParsers** is available to provide your own preferred parser to parse different data types as per your requirements. The following sample code demonstrates the usage of a preferred parser.

Sample source file and output files can be downloaded from the following links for testing this feature.

### **Opening Text Files with Custom Separator**

Text files are used to hold spreadsheet data without formatting. The file is a kind of plain text file that can have some customized delimiters.

### **Opening Tab-Delimited Files**

Tab-delimited (Text) files contain spreadsheet data but without any formatting. Data is arranged in rows and columns like in tables and spreadsheets. Basically, a tab-delimited file is a special kind of plain text file with a tab between each column.

### **Opening Tab-Separated Values (TSV) Files**

Tab-separated values (TSV) files contain spreadsheet data but without any formatting. It is the same as a tab-delimited file where data is arranged in rows and columns like in tables and spreadsheets.
