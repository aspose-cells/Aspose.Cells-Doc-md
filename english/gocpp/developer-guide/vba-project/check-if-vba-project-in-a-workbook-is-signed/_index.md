{{% alert color="primary" %}}

You can check if your VBA project is signed or not using Microsoft Excel via **Tools > Digital Signatures...** menu command. Similarly, you can check it programmatically using Aspose.Cells [**Workbook.VbaProject.IsSigned**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/issigned/).
