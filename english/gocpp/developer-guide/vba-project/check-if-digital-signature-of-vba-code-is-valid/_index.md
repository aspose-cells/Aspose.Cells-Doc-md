{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Aspose.Cells allows you to check if the digital signature of the VBA code is valid using the [**Workbook.VbaProject.IsValidSigned**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/isvalidsigned/) property. It will return **true** if the signature is valid; otherwise, it will return **false**. The digital signature of the VBA code becomes invalid when you change the VBA code.

## **Check if Digital Signature of VBA Code is Valid in C++**

The following code demonstrates the usage of this property using the [sample excel file](5115030.xlsm) which you can download from the provided link. The same Excel file has a valid signature, but when we modify its VBA code and save the workbook and then recheck, we find its signature has become invalid.
