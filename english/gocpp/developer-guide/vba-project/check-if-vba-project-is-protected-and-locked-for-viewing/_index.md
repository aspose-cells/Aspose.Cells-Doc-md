## Check if VBA Project is Protected and Locked for Viewing in C++

Aspose.Cells allows you to check whether the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) project of an Excel file is protected and locked for viewing. For this, the API provides the [**VbaProject.GetIslockedForViewing()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/getislockedforviewing/) property. If it is locked for viewing, the [**VbaProject.GetIslockedForViewing()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/getislockedforviewing/) property returns **true**.

## **Sample Code**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](43352065.xlsm) and checks whether the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) project of the Excel file is protected and locked for viewing. Please also see its console output for reference.
