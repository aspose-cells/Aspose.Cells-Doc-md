## Check if VBA Project is Protected and Locked for Viewing in C++

Aspose.Cells allows you to check if the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Project of an Excel file is protected and locked for viewing. For this, the API provides the [**VbaProject.GetIslockedForViewing()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/getislockedforviewing/) property. If it is locked for viewing, then the [**VbaProject.GetIslockedForViewing()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/vbaproject/getislockedforviewing/) property returns **true**.

## **Sample Code**
