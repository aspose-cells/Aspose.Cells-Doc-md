You can use Aspose.Cells to set the AutoRecover property of a workbook. The default value of this property is **true**. When you set it to **false** on a workbook, Microsoft Excel disables AutoRecover (Autosave) on that Excel file.

Aspose.Cells provides the [**Workbook.GetAutoRecover()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbooksettings/getautorecover/) property to enable or disable this option.

The following code explains how to use the [**Workbook.GetAutoRecover()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbooksettings/getautorecover/) property of the workbook. The code first reads the default value of this property, which is **true**, then sets it to **false** and saves the workbook. Then it reads the workbook again and reads the value of this property, which is **false** at this time.
