## Load an Image from a URL into an Excel Worksheet

Aspose.Cells for C++ API provides a straightforward method to load images from URLs into Excel Worksheets. This article explains how to download image data into a memory stream and insert it into the worksheet using Aspose.Cells. The image becomes embedded in the Excel file and doesn't require external downloads when opened.

## Sample Code

For scenarios requiring always-updated images from a URL, use the method described in [Insert a Linked Picture from Web Address](/cells/cpp/insert-a-linked-picture-from-web-address/). This approach loads the image from the URL each time the worksheet is opened.
