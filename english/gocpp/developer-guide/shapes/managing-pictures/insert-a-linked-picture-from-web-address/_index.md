Sometimes you need to insert a picture from the web (http://) into a worksheet. To do so, specify the pictureâ€™s URL and the picture will be downloaded every time the spreadsheet is opened in Microsoft Excel. The image is not physically embedded into the Excel document, but points to a web resource.

## **Using Microsoft Excel**

In Microsoft Excel (for example 2007):

1. Click the **Insert** menu and select **Picture**.
1. Specify the web address for the picture in the Insert Picture dialog.

## **Using Aspose.Cells for C++**

Aspose.Cells for C++ supports adding a linked image using the [**ShapeCollection::AddLinkedPicture(int upperLeftRow, int upperLeftColumn, int heightPixels, int widthPixels, System::String sourceFullName)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shapecollection/addlinkedpicture/) method. The method returns a [**Picture**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/) object.

The following example shows how to add a linked picture from a web address to a worksheet.
