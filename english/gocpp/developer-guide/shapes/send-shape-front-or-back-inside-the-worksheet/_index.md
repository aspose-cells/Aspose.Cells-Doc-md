## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When multiple shapes are present in the same location, their visibility is determined by their Z‑order positions. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/tofrontorback/) method, which changes the Z‑order position of a shape. If you want to send a shape to the back, use a negative number such as -1, -2, -3, etc. If you want to bring a shape to the front, use a positive number such as 1, 2, 3, etc.

## **Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**

The following sample code demonstrates the usage of the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/tofrontorback/) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528330.xlsx) used in the code and the [output Excel file](50528331.xlsx) generated by it. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file upon execution.
