Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.GetLeftToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getlefttocorner/) and [**Shape.GetTopToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/gettoptocorner/) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of the shape inside the worksheet in pixels.
