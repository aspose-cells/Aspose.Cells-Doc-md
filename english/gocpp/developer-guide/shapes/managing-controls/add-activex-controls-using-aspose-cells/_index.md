You can add ActiveX controls with Aspose.Cells using the [**ShapeCollection::AddActiveXControl()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shapecollection/addactivexcontrol/) method. This method takes a parameter [**ControlType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/controltype/)Â which specifies the type of ActiveX control to be added inside a worksheet. It has the following values:

- ControlType::CheckBox
- ControlType::ComboBox
- ControlType::CommandButton
- ControlType::Image
- ControlType::Label
- ControlType::ListBox
- ControlType::RadioButton
- ControlType::ScrollBar
- ControlType::SpinButton
- ControlType::TextBox
- ControlType::ToggleButton
- ControlType::Unknown

Once you have added the ActiveX control inside the shape collection, you can access the ActiveX control object via the [**Shape::get_ActiveXControl()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getactivexcontrol/) method and set its various properties.
