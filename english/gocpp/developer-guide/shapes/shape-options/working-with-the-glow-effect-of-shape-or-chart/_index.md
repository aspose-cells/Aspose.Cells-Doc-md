## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shapepropertycollection/getgloweffect/) property along with [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/) class to work with the glow effect of shape or chart. The [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [GlowEffect.Size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/gloweffect/getsize/)
- [GlowEffect.Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/gloweffect/gettransparency/)
- [GlowEffect.Color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/gloweffect/getcolor/)

## **Working with the Glow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115407.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [Shape.Glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/getgloweffect/) property and then saves the workbook in [output excel file](5115414.xlsx).
