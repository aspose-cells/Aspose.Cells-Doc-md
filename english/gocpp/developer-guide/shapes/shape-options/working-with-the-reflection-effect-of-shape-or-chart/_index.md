## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getreflection/) property along with [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/) class to work with the reflection effect of shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [Blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getblur/)
- [Direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getdirection/)
- [Distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getdistance/)
- [FadeDirection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getfadedirection/)
- [RotWithShape](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getrotwithshape/)
- [Size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getsize/)
- [Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/gettransparency/)
- [Type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/gettype/)

## **Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115424.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the default worksheet and sets different properties of [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/getreflection/) class and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115423.xlsx).
