---  

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getreflection/) property along with the [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/) class to work with the reflection effect of a shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/) class contains the following properties, which can be set to achieve different results according to application requirements.  

- [Blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getblur/)  
- [Direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getdirection/)  
- [Distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getdistance/)  
- [FadeDirection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getfadedirection/)  
- [RotWithShape](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getrotwithshape/)  
- [Size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/getsize/)  
- [Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/gettransparency/)  
- [Type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/reflectioneffect/gettype/)  

## **Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart**  
The following sample code loads the [source Excel file](5115424.xlsx), accesses the first shape in the default worksheet, sets different properties of the Shape.Reflection class, and then saves the workbook to the [output Excel file](5115423.xlsx).
