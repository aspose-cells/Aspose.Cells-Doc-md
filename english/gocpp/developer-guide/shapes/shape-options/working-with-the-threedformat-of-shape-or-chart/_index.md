---

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getthreedformat/) property along with the [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/) class to work with the 3‑D Format of shapes or charts. The [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/) class contains various properties that can be set to achieve different results according to application requirements.

## **Working with the ThreeDFormat of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the source **Excel** file ([5115419.xlsx](5115419.xlsx)) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet. It then sets the sub‑properties of the [Shape.ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/getthreedformat/) property and saves the workbook to the output **Excel** file ([5115410.xlsx](5115410.xlsx)).
