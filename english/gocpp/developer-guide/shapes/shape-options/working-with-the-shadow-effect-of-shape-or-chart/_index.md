## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [GetShadowEffect()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shape/getshadoweffect/) method along with the [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/) class to work with the shadow effect of shapes or charts. The [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [GetAngle()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getangle/)
- [GetBlur()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getblur/)
- [GetColor()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getcolor/)
- [GetDistance()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getdistance/)
- [GetPresetType()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getpresettype/)
- [GetSize()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/getsize/)
- [GetTransparency()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/shadoweffect/gettransparency/)

## **Working with the Shadow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115425.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [GetShadowEffect()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/getshadoweffect/) property and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115411.xlsx).
