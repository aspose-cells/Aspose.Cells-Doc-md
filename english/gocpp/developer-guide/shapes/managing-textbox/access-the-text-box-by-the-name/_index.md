## Access the Text Box by Name

Earlier, text boxes were accessed by index from the [**Worksheet.GetTextBoxes()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheet/gettextboxes/) collection, but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.

The following sample code first creates a text box and assigns it some text and a name. Then, in the following lines, we access the same text box by its name and print its text.
