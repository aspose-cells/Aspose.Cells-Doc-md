TextBoxes can improve the expressiveness of our documents and diagrams, and applying different alignments to various parts of a TextBox can help highlight points of interest to readers. However, the default alignment of a TextBox does not meet all our needs. For this reason, you may need to adjust each TextBox to satisfy your specific requirements. If you don't have many TextBox objects to tweak, you're in luck. If there are a large number of TextBoxes to adjust, you may encounter difficulties. Don't worry—[Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) provides an API that helps you accomplish this.

The following sample code applies text alignment to a TextBox.
