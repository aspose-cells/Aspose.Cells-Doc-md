description: Learn how to set margins of comments or shapes inside a worksheet using Aspose.Cells with Golang via C++.  
---  

## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [**Shape.GetTextAlignment()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/fontsettingcollection/gettextalignment/) property. This property returns the object of the [**Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Texts.ShapeTextAlignment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class, which has different properties e.g. [**GetTopMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/gettopmarginpt/), [**GetLeftMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getleftmarginpt/), [**GetBottomMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getbottommarginpt/), [**GetRightMarginPt()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/getrightmarginpt/), etc., that can be used to set the top, left, bottom, and right margins.  

## **Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet**  

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](61767851.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom, and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](61767852.xlsx) generated by the code and a screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.
