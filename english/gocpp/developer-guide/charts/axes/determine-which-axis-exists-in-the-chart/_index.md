Sometimes, users need to know if a particular axis exists in the chart. For example, they may want to know whether a Secondary Value Axis exists inside the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have an axis.

Aspose.Cells provides [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/chart/hasaxis/) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/chart/hasaxis/) to determine if the sample chart has Primary and Secondary Category and Value axes.
