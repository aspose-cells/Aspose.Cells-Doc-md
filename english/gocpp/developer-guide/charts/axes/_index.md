{{% alert color="primary" %}}

In Excel charts, there are three kinds of axes:
1. Horizontal (Category) Axis: X‑Axis
2. Vertical (Value) Axis: Y‑Axis
3. Depth (Series) Axis: Z‑Axis

## **Axis Options**
Aspose.Cells also allows you to manage a chart's axes at runtime. With the [Axis](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/axis/) object, you can change all options of the axis as in Excel.
