In Excel charts, there are 3 kinds of Axes:
1. Horizontal (Category) Axis : X Axis
1. Vertical (Value) Axis : Y Axis
1. Depth (Series) Axis : Z Axis

## **Axis Options**
Aspose.Cells also allows you to manage chart's axes at runtime. With the [Axis](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/axis/) object, you can change all options of the Axis as done in Excel.
