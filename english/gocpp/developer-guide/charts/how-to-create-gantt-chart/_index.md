## **What is Gantt chart**

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It shows the start and finish dates of the various elements of a project. Each task or activity is represented by a bar, with its length corresponding to its duration. Gantt charts also indicate dependencies between tasks, allowing project managers to visualize the sequence in which tasks need to be completed. They are widely used in project management to plan, schedule, and track projects effectively.
