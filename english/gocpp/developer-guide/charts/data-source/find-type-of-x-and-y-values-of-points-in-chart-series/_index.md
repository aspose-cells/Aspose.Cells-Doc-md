## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Sometimes, you want to know the type of X and Y values of chart points in a series. Aspose.Cells provides `ChartPoint::get_XValueType` and `ChartPoint::get_YValueType` methods that can be used for this purpose. Please note, you will have to call `Chart::Calculate()` method before you could use these properties effectively.

## **Find Type of X and Y Values of Points in Chart Series**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](64716905.xlsx) and accesses the first chart inside the first worksheet. It then calls the `Chart::Calculate()` method and finds the type of X and Y values of the first chart point and prints them on the console. Please see the console output shown below for a reference.
