## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
A treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and makes it easy to spot patterns, such as which items are a store's best sellers. The tree branches are represented by rectangles and each sub-branch is shown as a smaller rectangle. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity and can easily show lots of data which would be difficult with other chart types.
