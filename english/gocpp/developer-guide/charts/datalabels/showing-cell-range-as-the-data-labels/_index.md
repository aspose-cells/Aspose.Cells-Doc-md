In Microsoft Excel 2013, you can display a cell range for data labels. Aspose.Cells supports this feature.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Check-box to Show Cell Range as Data Labels**

To show the cell range as data labels in Microsoft Excel:

1. Select the series data labels and right-click to open the context menu.
1. Select **Format Data Labels**. Label options are displayed.
1. Select or clear the option **Label Contains - Value From Cells**.

The sample code below accesses a chart series data labels and sets the [**DataLabels.GetShowCellRange()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/datalabels/getshowcellrange/)Â property to **true** to select the **Label Contains - Value From Cells** option.
