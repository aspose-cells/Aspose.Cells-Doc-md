You can add custom labels to data points in the series of the chart. Aspose.Cells provides the [**DataLabel::getText()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/datalabels/gettext/) method to add these custom labels. This article will explain how to use this method to add custom labels to data points in the series of the chart.

The following code creates **Scatter Chart Connected By Lines With Data Markers** and then adds **Custom Labels** to the **Data Points** in the **Series** of the **Chart**. Each custom label shows the **Series Name** and **Point Name**. You can use any other text instead.
