You can use Aspose.Cells to create rich text custom data label of the chart point. Aspose.Cells provides the [DataLabels.Characters()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/charttextframe/characters/) method to return the [FontSetting](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/fontsetting/) object which can be used to set the font properties of the text like its color, boldness, etc.
