Please use the [**Workbook::ExportXml()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbook/exportxml_string_string/) method to export XML data linked to your XML Maps inside your workbook. The following sample code exports XML data of all XML Maps from the workbook one by one. Please check the [sample Excel file](5115497.xlsx) used in this code and the [exported XML data of the first XML Map](5472487.xml).
