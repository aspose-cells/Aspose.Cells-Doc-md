## **Custom sorting in Pivot Table**
By using the Aspose.Cells API, you can sort Pivot Tables on field values. The following code snippet loads the sample Excel file and adds three pivot tables. The first pivot table does not have custom sorting, the second pivot table is sorted on "Seafood" row field values, and the third pivot table is sorted on "28/07/2000" column field values.

Sample source file and output files can be downloaded from here for testing the sample code:
