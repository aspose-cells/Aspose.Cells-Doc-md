Microsoft Excel allows you to change the Layout of Pivot Table using *PivotTable Tools > Design > Report Layout* menu commands. You can change the Layout in these three forms:

- Show in Compact Form
- Show in Outline Form
- Show in Tabular Form

Aspose.Cells also provides [**PivotTable.ShowInCompactForm()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/pivottable/showincompactform/), [**PivotTable.ShowInOutlineForm()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.pivot/pivottable/showinoutlineform/), and [**PivotTable.ShowInTabularForm()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.pivot/pivottable/showintabularform/) methods to change the layout of pivot table in these three forms.

The following sample code first shows the Pivot Table in **Compact Form**, then it shows the Pivot Table in **Outline Form**, and lastly, it shows the Pivot Table in **Tabular Form**.
