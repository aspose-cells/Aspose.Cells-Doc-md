## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

There might be situations where you want to change the properties of a slicer, such as its placement or row height. Aspose.Cells provides the option to update these properties.

## **Change Slicer Properties**

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](sampleCreateSlicerToExcelTable.xlsx) that contains a table. It then creates the slicer based on the first column and changes its properties, such as row height, width, printable status, title, etc. It saves the workbook as [outputChangeSlicerProperties.xlsx](outputChangeSlicerProperties.xlsx).
