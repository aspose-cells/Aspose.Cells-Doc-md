## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can format the slicer in Microsoft Excel by setting its number of columns or by setting its style etc. Aspose.Cells also allows you to do this using the [**Slicer.GetNumberOfColumns()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/slicer/getnumberofcolumns/) and [**Slicer.GetStyleType()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/getstyletype/) properties.

## **Formatting Slicer**

Please see the following code; it loads the [sample Excel file](67338473.xlsx) that contains a slicer. It accesses the slicer and sets its number of columns and style type and saves it as [output Excel file](67338474.xlsx). The screenshot shows how the slicer looks after the execution of the sample code.
