--- 

Aspose.Cells provides the feature to replace text in a workbook using a regular expression. For this, the API provides the [**GetRegexKey()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/replaceoptions/getregexkey/) property of the [**ReplaceOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/) class. Setting the [**GetRegexKey()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/replaceoptions/getregexkey/) to **true** indicates that the searched key will be a regular expression.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [**GetRegexKey()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/replaceoptions/getregexkey/) property by using the [sample excel file](101089318.xlsx). The [output file](101089319.xlsx) generated by the following code snippet is attached for reference.
