description: Add custom ContentTypeProperties to an Excel file using Aspose.Cells with Golang via C++.
---

Aspose.Cells provides [**Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/contenttypepropertycollection/add_string_string/) method to add custom ContentTypeProperties to an Excel file. You may also make the property optional by setting the [**ContentTypeProperty.IsNillable**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypeproperty/isnillable/) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an Excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
