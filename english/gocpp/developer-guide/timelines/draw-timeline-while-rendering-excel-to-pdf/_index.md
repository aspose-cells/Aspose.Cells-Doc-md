## **Draw Timeline while rendering Excel to PDF**
If you have an Excel file which has a timeline applied to it and you want to export the Excel to PDF with the timeline settings, Aspose.Cells now supports this by default. You simply export the Excel file with a timeline to PDF, and the generated PDF will show the timeline applied.

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](input.xlsx) that contains an existing timeline. It then saves the workbook as [output PDF file](out.pdf). The following screenshot compares the source Excel file and the generated PDF file.
