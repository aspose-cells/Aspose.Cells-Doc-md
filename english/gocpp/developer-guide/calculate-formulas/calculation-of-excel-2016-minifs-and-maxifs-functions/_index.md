## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Microsoft Excel 2016 supports MINIFS and MAXIFS functions. These functions are not supported in Excel 2013 or earlier versions. Aspose.Cells also supports the calculation of these functions.

## **Calculation of Excel 2016 MINIFS and MAXIFS functions**
The following sample code loads the [sample excel file](5115149.xlsx) and calls the [Workbook.CalculateFormula()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/calculateformula/) method to perform the formula calculation via Aspose.Cells and then saves the results in the [output PDF](5115154.pdf).
