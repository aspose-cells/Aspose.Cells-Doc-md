## **Convert Excel to Markdown**  
Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports converting Excel files to Markdown format. To export the active worksheet to Markdown, pass [SaveFormat.Markdown](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/saveformat#MARKDOWN) as the second parameter of the [Workbook.Save](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/workbook#save\(java.lang.String,%20int\)) method. You may also use the [MarkdownSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/MarkdownSaveOptions) class to specify additional settings for exporting worksheets to Markdown.  

The following code example demonstrates exporting the active worksheet to Markdown by using the [SaveFormat.Markdown](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/saveformat#MARKDOWN) enumeration member. Please see the [output Markdown file](Book1.txt) generated by the code for reference.
