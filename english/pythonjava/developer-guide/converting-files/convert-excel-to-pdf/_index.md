## **Convert Excel to PDF**

PDF documents are widely used as a standard format of exchanging documents between organizations, government sectors, and individuals. Software developers are often asked to devise a way to easily convert Microsoft Excel files into PDF documents. Aspose.Cells for Python via Java API provides the ability to convert Excel files to PDF documents (including PDF/A). Aspose.Cell's converts spreadsheets to PDF with a high degree of accuracy and fidelity.

### **Direct Conversion**

To save an Excel file directly to PDF, you may use the [**Workbook.save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method and pass [**SaveFormat.PDF**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/saveformat#PDF) as the second parameter.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of [**SaveFormat.PDF**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/saveformat#PDF) and the [**Workbook.save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/workbook#save(java.lang.String,%20com.aspose.cells.SaveOptions)) method to convert Excel to PDF format.

### **Advanced Conversion**

To have more control over the conversion to PDF, the API provides the [**PdfSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/PdfSaveOptions) class. The [**PdfSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/PdfSaveOptions) class can be used to set different attributes for the conversion. Setting different properties of the [**PdfSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/PdfSaveOptions) class will give you control over the Print, Font, Security, and Compression settings for the resultant PDF file. The most notable property is the [**Compliance**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/pdfsaveoptions#Compliance) that enables you to save the Excel files to PDF/A compliant PDF files.

if your spreadsheet contains formulas, call the [**Workbook.calculateFormula**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/workbook#calculateFormula()) method just before rendering the spreadsheet to PDF. This ensures that the formula dependent values are recalculated and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
