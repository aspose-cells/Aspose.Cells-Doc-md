## **Draw Slicer while rendering Excel to PDF**
Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports exporting Excel to PDF with slicer settings. The API supports this by default. You simply export the Excel file with a slicer to PDF, and the generated PDF will show the slicer applied. The following code snippet loads the [sample Excel file](106365058.xlsx) that contains a slicer and saves the workbook as the [output PDF file](106365052.xlsx). The following screenshot compares the source Excel file and the generated PDF file.
