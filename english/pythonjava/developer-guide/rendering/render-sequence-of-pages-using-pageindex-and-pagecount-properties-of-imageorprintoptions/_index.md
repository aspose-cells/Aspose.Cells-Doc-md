## **Render Sequence of Pages using PageIndex and PageCount Properties of ImageOrPrintOptions**
You can render a sequence of pages of your Excel file to images using Aspose.Cells with the [ImageOrPrintOptions.PageIndex](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/imageorprintoptions#PageIndex) and [ImageOrPrintOptions.PageCount](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/imageorprintoptions#PageCount) properties. These properties are useful when there are many, e.g., thousands of pages in your worksheet, but you want to render only some of them. This will not only save processing time but also reduce memory consumption during the rendering process.

The following sample code loads the sample Excel file and renders only pages 4, 5, 6, and 7 using the [ImageOrPrintOptions.PageIndex](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/imageorprintoptions#PageIndex) and [ImageOrPrintOptions.PageCount](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/imageorprintoptions#PageCount) properties. The images below are the rendered pages generated by the sample code.
