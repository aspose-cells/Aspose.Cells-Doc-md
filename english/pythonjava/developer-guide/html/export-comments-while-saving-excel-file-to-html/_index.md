## **Export Comments while Saving Excel file to HTML**
When Excel is converted to HTML, comments are not exported. Aspose.Cells for Python via Java provides a feature to export comments when converting Excel to HTML. To achieve this, the API provides the [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property. Setting the value of [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property to **True** will export comments in the output HTML.

The following screenshot shows the output HTML file generated by the sample code snippet.
