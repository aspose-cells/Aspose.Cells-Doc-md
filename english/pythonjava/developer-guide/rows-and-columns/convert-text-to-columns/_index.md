## **Convert Text to Columns**
You can convert your Text to Columns using Microsoft Excel. This feature is available from *Data Tools* under the *Data* tab. In order to split the contents of a column to multiple columns, the data should contain a specific delimiter such as a comma (or any other character) based on which Microsoft Excel splits the contents of a cell into multiple cells. Aspose.Cells also provides this feature via the [TextToColumns](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/cells#textToColumns\(int,%20int,%20int,%20com.aspose.cells.TxtLoadOptions\)) method. The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [TextToColumns](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/cells#textToColumns\(int,%20int,%20int,%20com.aspose.cells.TxtLoadOptions\)) method by converting text to columns with space as a delimiter.
