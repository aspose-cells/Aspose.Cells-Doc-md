You can easily download Aspose.Cells for evaluation from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells/). The evaluation download is the same as the download for the full version: the evaluation becomes licensed when you apply a license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Cells (that is, Aspose.Cells without a license applied) provides most of the product functionality. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with an evaluation watermark when a spreadsheet is opened or saved. The injected extra evaluation watermark worksheet to the workbook is shown below:

If you want to test Aspose.Cells without evaluation version limitations, [request a 30-day temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license).
