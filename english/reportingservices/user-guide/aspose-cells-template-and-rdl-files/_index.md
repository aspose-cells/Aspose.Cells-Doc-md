A report definition contains data retrieval and layout information for a report. Report Definition Language (RDL) is an XML representation for report definition. RDL is an open schema: developers can extend RDL with additional attributes and elements. The standard file extension for report definition files is .rdl. Its MIME type is text/xml. 

An Aspose.Cells template is a Microsoft Excel workbook that contains report layout information and is saved into RDL Files (Format) when the template design work is completed. When an RDL file that does not contain an Aspose.Cells template is opened, only its data sources and queries are available for use in Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer. When an RDL file that contains a Aspose.Cells template is opened, the template is retrieved and opened as a workbook in Microsoft Excel.
