Gridlines are configured in **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** so you can control whether an exported Microsoft Excel file shows grid lines. The default value is **off**, meaning that gridlines are not displayed.

{{< highlight java >}}

 <Aspose>

  <DataWorkSheet> 

    <GridLine value="off"/>

  </DataWorkSheet>
