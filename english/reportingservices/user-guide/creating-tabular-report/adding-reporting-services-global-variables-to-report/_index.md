Aspose.Cells' report template supports Reporting Services' global variables as a data source for cells that contain a Reporting Services global variables marker. 

[Aspose.Cells Template and Smart Markers](/cells/reportingservices/aspose-cells-template-and-smart-markers/) explains how Reporting Services Global Variables markers work. Global variables are normally placed in the text area of a table header or footer.
