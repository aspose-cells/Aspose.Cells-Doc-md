The **Extended Rendering Extensions** feature expands the default list of export options that come with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). When enabled, users can choose any of the formats listed below directly from the **Export** dropdown in the report viewer.

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services supports export to **PDF** and **HTML** formats, as well as the core Microsoft Excel spreadsheet formats (**XLS**, **XLSX**, **XLSB**) and other popular formats such as **ODS**, **Json**, **Markdown**, **Png**, **Pptx**, **CSV**, **TXT**, and so on. This page explains how to enable the *Extended Rendering Extensions* feature, configure the supported formats, and use them in your SSRS reports.
