{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

We have introduced the Composite Markers feature. Now, the user can join markers together as a composite marker by using the concatenation character, i.e., '&'. For example, *=& Parameters!ReportYear.Value & "-" & Parameters!ReportMonth.Value & " Sales Report"*. The marker consists of two parameter markers and two static text markers.
