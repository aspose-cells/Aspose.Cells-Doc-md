We’ve added native support for **Matrix** report items in Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services.  
A matrix consists of a **corner**, **column groupings**, **row groupings**, and **matrix rows**. Use the **Set Attribute** button on Aspose.Cells’ command bar to define matrix properties such as **Name**, **Range**, **Header**, etc.

> **Example:** In the screenshot below the matrix occupies the range **E9:G11**.  

## What is a Matrix Report Item?

A matrix (also known as a *crosstab*) lets you display data in a two‑dimensional grid where both rows and columns can be grouped dynamically. It is ideal for:

- Summarising sales by region (rows) and by month (columns).  
- Pivot‑style reporting without writing complex SQL.  
- Providing drill‑down capabilities in SSRS reports.
