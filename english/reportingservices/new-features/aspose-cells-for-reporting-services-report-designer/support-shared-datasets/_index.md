## Overview

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services fully supports **SSRS 2008 R2 shared datasets**.  
When the Aspose.Cells Report Designer opens a report definition (`.rdl`) that references a shared dataset, it automatically retrieves the dataset’s schema—including field names and data types—directly from the Report Server.
