## **Overview**

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services (RS) extends Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) by adding full‑featured Excel‑style capabilities directly inside the Report Designer. It enables developers and report authors to work with shared datasets, import SSRS 2008/2008R2 definition files, configure server‑side caching, and control tablix group page‑break behavior—all without leaving the familiar SSRS environment.
