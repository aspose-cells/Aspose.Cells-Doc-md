## Overview

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services **Report Designer** can read a Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) report definition file (`.rdl`) created with SSRS 2008 or SSRS 2008 R2.  
When the file is imported, the designer translates supported report items (tables, matrices, charts, etc.) into native Aspose.Cells objects, allowing you to edit the layout and export the report directly to an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`).

> **Why import?**  
> • Re‑use existing SSRS reports without rebuilding them from scratch.  
> • Take advantage of Aspose.Cells’ rich Excel‑specific features (conditional formatting, formulas, styling).  
> • Generate Excel files on the server with a single click.
