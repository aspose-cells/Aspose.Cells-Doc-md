## Overview - Add Settings for Page Setup in Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services Renderer

**Page Setup** is a set of properties that control the appearance of a worksheet when it is printed.

When you export a report to Excel using **Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services**, the renderer creates a workbook whose worksheets inherit page‑setup values from the **Aspose.Cells Reporting Services configuration file** (`Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.config`).  
Configuring these settings lets you control how the generated Excel file prints or appears in the Excel UI (orientation, margins, scaling, paper size, etc.) without modifying the report definition.
