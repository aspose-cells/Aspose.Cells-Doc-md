## Overview

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services allows you to control the order of rows in a **Table** item when the report is exported to an Excel workbook. By adding a **sorting configuration** to the Aspose.Cells Reporting Services configuration file (`Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.config`), you can specify one or more columns to sort by, the sort direction, and optional custom comparers.

> **Note** – The sorting is applied **only** during the rendering phase for Excel (XLS, XLSX) output. Other render formats (HTML, PDF, etc.) are unaffected.

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services sorts table item data for the exported Excel file by adding a table‑sorting configuration in the Aspose.Cells Reporting Services configuration file.
