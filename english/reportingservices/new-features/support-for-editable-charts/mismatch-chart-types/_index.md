Some chart types in the SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 report definition file are not available as Excel chart types:

- Line-Stepped
- Range-Plain
- Range-Smooth
- Range-Column
- Range-Bar
- Range-ErrorBar
- Range-BoxPlot
- Shape-Funnel

When rendering chart items that do not have equivalent options in Microsoft Excel, Aspose.Cells outputs them to images.
