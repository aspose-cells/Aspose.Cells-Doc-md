Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services enables you to export **Reporting Services chart items** directly to Excel while preserving full editability.  
This page consolidates the most frequently used scenarios and provides quick links to the corresponding tutorials.

## Overview

When a report containing chart visualizations is exported to Excel, the default rendering often produces static images.  
By using the **editable‑chart** feature, each chart is converted into a native Excel chart object, allowing end‑users to:

* Modify series, axes, and data labels directly in Excel.  
* Apply Excel‑specific formatting (themes, styles, data tables).  
* Keep the original data source linked for easy updates.

Below are the step‑by‑step guides that cover every export scenario.
