**Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services** fully supports the RDL specification. This means you can easily port existing RDL reports to an Aspose solution without rewriting them.

## Overview

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services implements the complete RDL (Report Definition Language) specification. By leveraging this native support, developers can migrate their existing RDL‑based reports to Aspose with minimal effort while retaining all layout, formatting, and interactive features.

## Supported RDL Elements

Aspose.Cells supports the following RDL elements out‑of‑the‑box:

- **Page, headers, footers** – Full control over page size, margins, and repeated header/footer sections.
- **Textboxes** – Static and dynamic text, expression‑based content, and rich formatting.
- **Images** – Embedded, external, and data‑driven images with scaling options.
- **Charts** – All standard chart types (column, line, pie, etc.) with full styling capabilities.
- **Lists** – Repeating data regions with custom grouping.
- **Tables** – Simple tabular data with row/column grouping and sorting.
- **Matrices** – Dynamic cross‑tab reports with row and column groups.
- **Styles** – Global and element‑level styling, including font, color, and borders.
- **Rectangles & lines** – Layout containers and drawing primitives.
- **Subreports** – Nested reports that inherit parameters and data sources.
- **Tablix** – Unified table/matrix component for flexible data presentation.
- **Gauge** – Visual indicators such as linear, radial, and digital gauges.

## Why This Matters

- **Seamless Migration** – No need to redesign reports; simply point to the Aspose renderer.
- **Consistent Rendering** – Identical visual output across browsers and export formats (PDF, XLSX, etc.).
- **Performance** – Optimized processing engine reduces rendering time for large data sets.
- **Extended Export Options** – Leverage Aspose’s powerful export capabilities while keeping the original RDL layout.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services extension** in your Reporting Services environment.  
2. **Update your report’s rendering extension** in the `RSReportServer.config` file to use Aspose.  
3. **Deploy your existing RDL files** as usual; Aspose will handle the rendering automatically.
