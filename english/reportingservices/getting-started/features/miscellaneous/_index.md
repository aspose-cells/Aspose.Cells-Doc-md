## Overview

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services extends the native functionality of Microsoft Reporting Services with a rich set of features that make designing, publishing, and maintaining Excel‑based reports faster and more flexible. Below is a concise list of the most valuable capabilities you can leverage when building reports with this product.

## **Key Benefits of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services**

- **Support for grouped rows and footers** – Create tables that contain hierarchical row groups and automatic footers. Grouping can be defined at design‑time just like any other report item, allowing you to build complex, multi‑level reports without extra code.

- **Parameters and global variables as data sources** – Use report parameters or global variables directly as the source of data for a cell range. This enables dynamic, user‑driven content without the need for additional datasets.

- **Microsoft Query integration** – Build data sources and queries with Microsoft Query, a familiar tool for most users. The familiar UI reduces the learning curve and speeds up data‑source creation.

- **Flexible data‑source handling** –
  - *Report‑specific data sources* can be defined during design for quick testing.
  - *Shared data sources* created on the Report Server can be swapped in at publish time, allowing you to maintain a single source of truth across many reports.
