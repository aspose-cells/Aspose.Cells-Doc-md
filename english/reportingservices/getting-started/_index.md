## Getting Started with Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services consists of **two components** that work together to let you design and render reports directly from Microsoft Excel.

### 1. Aspose.Cells Report Designer  

*An Excel add‑in that serves as a visual report designer.*

- Design report templates **inside Microsoft Excel** – no need to switch to Visual Studio.  
- Embed the Excel template into an RDL file, which can then be published to a Report Server.  
- Preview and export reports directly from the designer.

### 2. Aspose.Cells Renderer for Reporting Services  

*The rendering extension that integrates with Microsoft Reporting Services.*

- Implements the native **Reporting Services Rendering Extension**.  
- Renders RDL reports created with **both** Visual Studio and Aspose.Cells Report Designer.
