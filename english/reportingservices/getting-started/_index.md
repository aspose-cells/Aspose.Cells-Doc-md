Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services is comprised of **two parts** as follows:

- ***Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer***
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a report designer tool that is integrated with MS Excel in an Add‑ins form. With Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer, users can design a report template in MS Excel instead of Visual Studio. The report template is then embedded into a Reporting Services RDL file and can be published to the Report Server. Users can also preview and export the report in Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer.

- ***Aspose.Cells.Renderer for Reporting Services***
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspose.Cells.Renderer for Reporting Services is actually an implementation of the Microsoft Reporting Services Rendering Extension. It can render RDL reports designed by both Visual Studio and Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer.
