**Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services** is available as a free, time‑unlimited evaluation from the [Download Page](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices). The evaluation and licensed versions of the product are identical.

When you are satisfied with the evaluation, purchase a license. Be sure you understand and agree to the subscription terms and conditions.

## Getting and Using the License

1. **Obtain the license file** – After your order is paid, the license file will be available for download on the order page.  
2. **Copy the file** to one of the following folders (use the exact path for your environment):

   ```text
   <Installation Folder>\License\
   <MSSQL Server Reporting Services>\ReportServer\Bin\
   <MSSQL Server Reporting Services>\ReportServer\
   ```

   > **Note:** The folder name is case‑insensitive on Windows, but keep the back‑slashes as shown.

3. **License file name** – The name depends on the subscription you bought. Acceptable names include:

   - `Aspose.Cells.Reporting.Services.lic`
   - `Aspose.Total.ReportingServices.lic`
   - `Aspose.Custom.lic`
   - `Aspose.Total.lic`
   - `Aspose.Cells.Reporting.Services - Developer Site Subscription.lic`
   - `Aspose.Cells.Reporting.Services - Developer Subscription.lic`
   - `Aspose.Cells.Reporting.Services - Multiple Deployment Subscription.lic`
   - `Aspose.Cells.Reporting.Services - Single Server Deployment Subscription.lic`

4. **Verify the installation** – Export any report as a Microsoft Excel workbook.

   - If the workbook **does not contain** a watermark worksheet at the end, the license file was activated successfully.  
   - If a watermark worksheet appears, the product is still running in evaluation mode.

### What the watermark looks like

### Quick troubleshooting checklist

| ✅ Step | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1** | Confirm the license file is placed in one of the three allowed folders. |
| **2** | Verify the file name matches exactly one of the supported names. |
| **3** | Ensure the file has not been edited – it must remain the original, digitally‑signed XML. |
| **4** | Re‑export a report to Excel and check for the watermark worksheet. |
| **5** | If an error appears, open the generated report and read the message for clues (e.g., “License file not found” or “Invalid license signature”). |

If the issue persists, contact **Aspose.Support@aspose.com** with the following details:

* Product name and version  
* Full path of the license file  
* The exact error message shown in the report
