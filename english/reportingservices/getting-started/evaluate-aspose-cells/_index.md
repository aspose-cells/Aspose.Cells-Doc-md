{{% alert color="primary" %}}
You can download **Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services** for evaluation from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices/).
The evaluation package is identical to the purchased one – the only difference is that it runs in *evaluation mode* until you apply a license ([see licensing guide](/cells/reportingservices/licensing/)).

## What to Expect from the Evaluation Version

The evaluation build works fully, but it adds an extra worksheet that contains an
evaluation watermark. This worksheet is automatically inserted each time a
spreadsheet is opened or saved.

### Example – Watermark Worksheet

| Step | Screenshot |
|------|------------|
| 1. Workbook created by Aspose.Cells (no watermark yet) | ![Demo spreadsheet created by Aspose.Cells](/reportingservices/images/evaluate-aspose-cells_1.png) |
| 2. Workbook after opening/saving – watermark worksheet appears | ![Evaluation watermark worksheet added to the workbook](/reportingservices/images/evaluate-aspose-cells_2.png) |

> **Note:** The extra sheet is named **“Evaluation Warning”** and contains the text *“This workbook was created with an evaluation version of Aspose.Cells.”* It does **not** affect the data or formulas in your original worksheets.

## Removing the Watermark – Use a Temporary License

If you need to test the component without the evaluation limitation, request a
30‑day temporary license:

- Go to the **[Temporary License request page]**(<https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license>).
- Fill in the required details (company name, email, etc.).
- After receiving the license file, add it to your Reporting Services project
  as described in the [licensing documentation](/cells/reportingservices/licensing/).

Once the license is applied, the extra “Evaluation Warning” worksheet will no
longer be generated.

## Quick Checklist for Evaluation

- [ ] Download the evaluation package from the official site.  
- [ ] Install the package into your Reporting Services project.  
- [ ] Run a test report and verify that the watermark worksheet appears.  
- [ ] Request a temporary license if you need a clean workbook for further testing.  
- [ ] Apply the license file and re‑run the report to confirm the watermark is gone.
