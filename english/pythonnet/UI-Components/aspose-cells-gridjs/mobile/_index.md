## Use GridJs on a Mobile Device

You can use GridJs smoothly on the mobile device.  

GridJs can adapt to the mobile screen.

Run the [demo of GridJs](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells.Grid-for-Python-via-.NET/tree/main/Examples.GridJs "demo of GridJs")

You need to access the page via IP on the mobile device, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:2022.

You can use a small tool such as iisexpress-proxy.

Install with the following command:

* npm install -g iisexpress-proxy

Run the command to complete the port mapping:

* iisexpress-proxy 2022 82

Then we can open the demo web page in the mobile browser.

Navigate to the page http://yourip:82/.

Then we can perform edit operations as on a PC.
