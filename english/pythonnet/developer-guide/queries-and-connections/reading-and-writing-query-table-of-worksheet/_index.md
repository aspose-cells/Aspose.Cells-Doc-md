{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides a Worksheet.QueryTables collection which returns an object of type QueryTable by index. It has the following two properties:

- QueryTable.AdjustColumnWidth  
- QueryTable.PreserveFormatting  

These are both Boolean values. You can view them in Microsoft Excel via **Data > Connections > Properties**.

## Reading and Writing Query Table of Worksheet

The following sample code reads the first QueryTable of the first worksheet and then prints both QueryTable properties. It then sets the QueryTable.PreserveFormatting to true.
