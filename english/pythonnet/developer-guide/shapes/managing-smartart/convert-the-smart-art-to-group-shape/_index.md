## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can convert a Smart Art shape into a group shape using the [**Shape.get_result_of_smart_art()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/get_result_of_smart_art/#) method. It will enable you to handle a Smart Art shape like a group shape. Consequently, you will have access to the individual parts or shapes of the group shape.

## **Convert the Smart Art to Group Shape**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](55541793.xlsx) containing a Smart Art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then converts the Smart Art shape into a group shape and prints the Shape.IsGroup property. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
