## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Smart Art Shapes are special shapes in Microsoft Excel that allow you to create complex diagrams automatically. You can find if the shape is a smart art shape or normal shape using [**Shape.is_smart_art**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/is_smart_art) property.

## **Determine if Shape is Smart Art Shape**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](55541792.xlsx) containing a smart art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then prints the value of [**Shape.is_smart_art**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/is_smart_art) property of the first shape. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
