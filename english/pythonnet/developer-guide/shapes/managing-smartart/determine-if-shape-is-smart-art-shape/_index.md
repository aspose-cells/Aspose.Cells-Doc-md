## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Smart Art shapes are special shapes in Microsoft Excel that allow you to create complex diagrams automatically. You can determine whether a shape is a Smart Art shape or a regular shape using the **Shape.is_smart_art** property.

## **Determine if Shape is Smart Art Shape**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](55541792.xlsx) containing a Smart Art shape, as shown in this screenshot. It then prints the value of the **Shape.is_smart_art** property for the first shape. See the console output of the sample code below.
