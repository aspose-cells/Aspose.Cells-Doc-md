## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location then how will they be visible is decided by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Shape.to_front_or_back()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/to_front_or_back) method which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send shape to back you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. and if you want to send shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.

## **Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**

The following sample code explains the usage of [**Shape.to_front_or_back()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/to_front_or_back) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528330.xlsx) used inside the code and the [output Excel file](50528331.xlsx) generated by it. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file on execution.
