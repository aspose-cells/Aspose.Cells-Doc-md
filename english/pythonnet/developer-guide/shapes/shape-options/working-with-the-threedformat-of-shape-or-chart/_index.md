## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/three_d_format/) property along with the [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat) class to work with the 3‑D format of a shape or chart. The ThreeDFormat class contains various properties that can be set to achieve the desired results according to application requirements.

## **Working with the ThreeDFormat of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the source Excel file, accesses the first shape in the first worksheet, sets the sub‑properties of the [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/three_d_format/) property, and then saves the workbook to the output Excel file.
