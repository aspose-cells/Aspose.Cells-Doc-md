## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/three_d_format/) property along with [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat) class to work with the 3-D Format of shape or chart. The [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat) class contains different properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.


## **Working with the ThreeDFormat of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115419.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/three_d_format/) property and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115410.xlsx).
