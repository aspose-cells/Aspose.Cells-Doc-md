## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.shadow_effect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/shadow_effect) property along with the [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect) class to work with the shadow effect of a shape or chart. The [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect) class contains the following properties that can be set to achieve different results according to application requirements.

- [angle](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/angle)
- [blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/blur)
- [color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/color)
- [distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/distance)
- [preset_type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/preset_type)
- [size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/size)
- [transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/transparency)

## **Working with the Shadow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source Excel file](5115425.xlsx), accesses the first shape in the first worksheet, sets the sub-properties of the [Shape.shadow_effect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/shadow_effect) property, and then saves the workbook to the [output Excel file](5115411.xlsx).
