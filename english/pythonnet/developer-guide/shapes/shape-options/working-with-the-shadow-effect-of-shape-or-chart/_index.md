## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.shadow_effect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/shadow_effect) property along with [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect) class to work with the shadow effect of shape or chart. The [ShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [angle](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/angle)
- [blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/blur)
- [color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/color)
- [distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/distance)
- [preset_type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/preset_type)
- [size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/size)
- [transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/transparency)

## **Working with the Shadow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115425.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [Shape.shadow_effect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/shadow_effect) property and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115411.xlsx).
