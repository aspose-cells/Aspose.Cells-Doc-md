## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/reflection) property along with [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class to work with the reflection effect of shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/blur)
- [direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/direction)
- [distance](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/distance)
- [fade_direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/fade_direction)
- [tot_with_shape](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/rot_with_shape)
- [size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/size)
- [transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/transparency)
- [type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/type)


## **Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115424.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the default worksheet and sets different properties of [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) class and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115423.xlsx).
