## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/glow) property along with [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class to work with the glow effect of shape or chart. The [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [GlowEffect.size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/size)
- [GlowEffect.transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/transparency)
- [GlowEffect.color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/color)

## **Working with the Glow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115407.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [Shape.glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/glow) property and then saves the workbook in [output excel file](5115414.xlsx).
