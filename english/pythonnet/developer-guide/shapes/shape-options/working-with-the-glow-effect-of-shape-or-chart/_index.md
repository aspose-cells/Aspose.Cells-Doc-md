## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [Shape.glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/glow) property along with the [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class to work with the glow effect of a shape or chart. The [GlowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

- [GlowEffect.size](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/size)
- [GlowEffect.transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/transparency)
- [GlowEffect.color](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/gloweffect/color)

## **Working with the Glow Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the source **Excel** file, accesses the first shape in the first worksheet, sets the sub‑properties of the [Shape.glow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/glow) property, and then saves the workbook to the output **Excel** file.
