You can set the **Shadow** of **Text Effects** of any Shape or TextBox. Please use the [**Shape.text_body**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/text_body) property. It presents the setting of the shape's text and returns [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects. After accessing it, please set the **Shadow** via [**FontSetting.text_options.shadow.preset_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/preset_type) property. This property is of the type [**PresetShadowType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/presetshadowtype/) which has several values. Some of these are

- OFFSET_DIAGONAL_BOTTOM_RIGHT
- OFFSET_BOTTOM
- OFFSET_DIAGONAL_TOP_RIGHT
- INSIDE_LEFT
- INSIDE_CENTER
- PERSPECTIVE_DIAGONAL_UPPER_LEFT
- PERSPECTIVE_DIAGONAL_UPPER_RIGHT
