## Add Icons to Worksheet in Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET

If you need to use [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) to add **icons** in an Excel file, then this document can provide you with some help.

The Excel interface corresponding to the insert‑icon operation is as follows:

- Left click *Insert*, it will be inserted into the Excel file.

The effect is as follows:

Here, we have prepared *sample code* to help you insert icons using [Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/). There is also a sample file ([sample.xlsx]) and an icon resource file ([icon.zip]). We used the Excel interface to insert an icon with the same display effect as the resource file in the sample file.
