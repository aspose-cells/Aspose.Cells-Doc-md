## Load an Image from a URL into an Excel Worksheet

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API provides a simple and easy way to load images from URLs into Excel Worksheets. This article explains downloading the image data into a stream and then inserting it into the worksheet using the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API. Using this method, the images become a part of the Excel file and are not downloaded every time the worksheet is opened.

## Sample Code

{{< gist "aspose-cells-gists" "7bb30376b4d40cdfd596286870fb9752" "Shapes-Pictures-LoadWebImage-1.py" >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

There might be cases where you always want the updated image from a URL. To achieve this, you may follow the instructions given in the [Insert a Linked Picture from Web Address](/cells/python-net/insert-a-linked-picture-from-web-address/) article. By following this method, the image is loaded from the URL each time the worksheet is opened.
