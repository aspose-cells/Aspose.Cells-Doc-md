Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to modify the adjustment points of shapes. In the Microsoft Excel UI, adjustments are displayed as yellow diamond nodes. For example:

- Rounded Rectangle has an adjustment to change the arc.  
- Triangle has an adjustment to change the location of the point.  
- Trapezoid has an adjustment to change the width of the top.  
- Arrows have two adjustments to change the shape of the head and tail.  

This article will explain the use of the [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to change the adjustment values of different shapes.
