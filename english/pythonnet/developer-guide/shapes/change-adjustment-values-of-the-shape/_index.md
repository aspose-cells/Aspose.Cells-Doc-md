Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to make changes to the adjustment points with shapes. In the Microsoft Excel UI, adjustments display as yellow diamond nodes. For example:

- Rounded Rectangle has an adjustment to change the arc
- Triangle has an adjustment to change the location of the point
- Trapezoid has an adjustment to change the width of the top
- Arrows have two adjustments to change the shape of the head and tail

This article will explain the use of [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to change the adjustment value of the different shapes.
