Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Shape.left_to_corner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/left_to_corner) and [**Shape.top_to_corner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/top_to_corner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of the shape inside the worksheet in pixels.
