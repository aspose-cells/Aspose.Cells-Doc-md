## **Access the Text Box by the Name**

Text boxes can be accessed by index from the [**Worksheet.text_boxes**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/text_boxes/) collection. You can also access text boxes by name using the collection's indexer property. This provides a convenient way to access specific text boxes when you know their names.

The following sample code demonstrates how to:
1. Create a text box with custom text and name
2. Access the text box by its name
3. Retrieve and display the text box's content

### **Python code to access the text box by name**

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook

# Create an object of the Workbook class
workbook = Workbook()

# Access first worksheet from the collection
sheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

# Add the TextBox to the worksheet
idx = sheet.text_boxes.add(10, 10, 10, 10)

# Access newly created TextBox using its index & name it
tb1 = sheet.text_boxes[idx]
tb1.name = "MyTextBox"

# Set text for the TextBox
tb1.text = "This is MyTextBox"

# Access the same TextBox via its name
tb2 = sheet.text_boxes["MyTextBox"]

# Display the text of the TextBox accessed via name
print(tb2.text)

print("Press any key to continue...")
input()
```

### **Console output generated by the sample code**

{{< highlight python >}}
This is MyTextBox
{{< /highlight >}}
