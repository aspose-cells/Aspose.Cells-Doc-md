Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides rich features to manage shapes in a spreadsheet. Sometimes there is a need to retrieve the connection points of a shape for aligning or placing shapes appropriately. For this purpose, all connection points are required. The following code can be used to get the list of connection points of a shape by using the [Shape.ConnectionPoints](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/connection_points) property.
