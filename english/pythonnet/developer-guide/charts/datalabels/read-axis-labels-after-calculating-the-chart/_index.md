## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

You can read axis labels of your chart after calculating its values using the [**Chart.calculate()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/calculate/) method. Please use the [**Axis.get_axis_texts()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/axis/get_axis_texts) method for this purpose, which will return the list of axis labels.  

## **Read Axis Labels after Calculating the Chart**  

Please see the following sample code that loads the [sample Excel file](ReadAxisLabels.xlsx) and reads the category‑axis labels of the chart in the first worksheet. It then prints the values of the axis labels to the console. See the console output of the sample code below for reference.
