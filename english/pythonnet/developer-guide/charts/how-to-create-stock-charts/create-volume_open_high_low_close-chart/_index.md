## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
The fourth stock chart we will look at is the Volume Open High Low Close chart. Again, it is important to repeat that you must have the data in the correct order. If you need to rearrange your data table, you should do it before you set up your chart.  
This chart includes a column for volume immediately after the first (category) column, and the chart includes a column chart on the primary axis showing this volume, while the prices are moved to the secondary axis.
