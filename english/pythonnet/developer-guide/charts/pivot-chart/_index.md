## What is PivotChart

A pivot chart is a visual representation of the data in a pivot table. Pivot charts provide a way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present summary data. Here are some key features and aspects of pivot charts:

1. Dynamic Data Representation: Pivot charts automatically update to reflect changes in the pivot table. If you add or remove fields in the pivot table, the pivot chart updates accordingly.

1. Interactive: Pivot charts are interactive, allowing users to filter, sort, and drill down into data. This makes it easy to explore different aspects of the data set.

1. Flexible Layout: Users can change the layout of the pivot chart by dragging and dropping fields, which offers flexibility in how data is visualized.

1. Various Chart Types: Pivot charts can be created using various chart types such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and more, depending on the nature of the data and the insights you wish to gain.

1. Summarization: Pivot charts summarize large amounts of data and can show totals, averages, counts, or other summary statistics.

1. Filtering: They provide filtering capabilities, allowing you to display only the data that meets certain criteria.
