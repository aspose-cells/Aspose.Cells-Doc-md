## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Sometime, you want to know the type of X and Y values of chart points in a series. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**ChartPoint.x_value_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint/x_value_type/) and [**ChartPoint.y_value_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint/y_value_type/) properties that can be used for this purpose. Please note, you will have to call [**Chart.calculate()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/calculate/#) method before you could use these properties effectively.

## **Find Type of X and Y Values of Points in Chart Series**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](64716905.xlsx) and accesses the first chart inside the first worksheet. It then calls the [**Chart.calculate()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/calculate/#) method and finds the type of X and Y values of first chart point and prints them on console. Please see the console output shown below for a reference.
