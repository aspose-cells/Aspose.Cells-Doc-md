In our previous topics, we have already provided many examples to demonstrate that how can you set a data source for your chart but in this topic, we are going to provide more details about the types of data that can be set for a chart.

## **Setting Chart Data**

There are two types of data to deal with while working on charts using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET as follows:

- Chart data.
- Category data.

### **Chart Data**

Chart data is the data that we use as a data source to build our charts. We can add a range of the cells (containing chart data) by calling the [**SeriesCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection) object's [**add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/add) method.

### **Category Data**

Category data is used for the labeling of chart data and can be added to [**SeriesCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection) by using its [**category_data**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/category_data) property. A complete example is given below to demonstrate the use of chart and category data. After executing the above example code, a column chart will be added to the worksheet as shown below.
