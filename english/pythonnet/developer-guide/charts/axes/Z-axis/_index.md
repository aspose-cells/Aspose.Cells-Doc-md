## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
For some 3‑D charts such as 3‑D column, 3‑D cone, or 3‑D pyramid, which have a depth (series) axis—also known as the Z axis—you can change it. You can specify the interval between tick marks, axis labels, and other operations.

## **Handle Primary and Secondary Axis like Microsoft Excel**
Please see the following sample code that creates a new Excel file and places the chart data in the first worksheet. Then we add a chart and set the chart type to Column3D, after which you can see the Z Axis, also called the Depth Axis.
