## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Combo charts in Excel let you take advantage of this option because you can easily combine two or more chart types to make your data understandable. Combo charts are helpful when your data contains multiple kinds of values, including price and volume. Moreover, combo charts are useful when your data numbers change widely from series to series.  

Taking the following dataset as an example, we can observe that the data are quite similar to the data mentioned in [**VHCL**](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/python-net/create-volume-high-low-close-stock-chart/). If we want to visualize series0, which corresponds to **"Total Revenue,"** as a line chart, how should we proceed?
