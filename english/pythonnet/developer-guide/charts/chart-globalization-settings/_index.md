## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Aspose.Cells APIs provide the [**ChartGlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/) class to handle scenarios where users need to set chart components to different languages. This allows customization of labels for subtotals and other elements in spreadsheets.

## **Introduction to ChartGlobalizationSettings Class**

The [**ChartGlobalizationSettings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/) class offers the following 8 methods that can be overridden in a custom class to translate elements like AxisTitle, AxisUnit, ChartTitle, etc., into different languages:
1. [**get_axis_title_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_axis_title_name/): Gets the name of the Axis Title.
1. [**get_axis_unit_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_axis_unit_name/): Gets the name of the Axis Unit.
1. [**get_chart_title_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_chart_title_name/): Gets the name of the Chart Title.
1. [**get_legend_decrease_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_legend_decrease_name/): Gets the name of "Decrease" for Legend.
1. [**get_legend_increase_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_legend_increase_name/): Gets the name of "Increase" for Legend.
1. [**get_legend_total_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_legend_total_name/): Gets the name of "Total" for Legend.
1. [**get_other_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_other_name/): Gets the name of "Other" labels for Chart.
1. [**get_series_name**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartglobalizationsettings/get_series_name/): Gets the name of Series in the Chart.

### **Custom Language Translation**
We'll create a waterfall chart using sample data where chart components display in English. We'll demonstrate Turkish translations for Chart Title, Legend Increase/Decrease names, Total name, and Axis Title.

## **Sample Code**
The following code loads the [sample Excel file](waterfall.xlsx):

```python
import os
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartGlobalizationSettings


class TurkeyChartGlobalizationSettings(ChartGlobalizationSettings):
    def get_chart_title_name(self):
        return "Grafik Başlığı"  # Chart Title
    
    def get_legend_increase_name(self):
        return "Artış"  # Increase
    
    def get_legend_decrease_name(self):
        return "Düşüş"  # Decrease
    
    def get_legend_total_name(self):
        return "Toplam"  # Total
    
    def get_axis_title_name(self):
        return "Eksen Başlığı"  # Axis Title


def chart_globalization_settings_test():
    # Create an instance of existing Workbook
    path_name = os.path.abspath("input.xlsx")
    workbook = Workbook(path_name)
    
    # Set custom chartGlobalizationSettings
    workbook.settings.globalization_settings.chart_settings = TurkeyChartGlobalizationSettings()
    
    # Get the worksheet 
    worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
    chart_collection = worksheet.charts
    
    # Load the chart from source worksheet
    chart = chart_collection[0]
    
    # Chart Calculate
    chart.calculate()
    
    # Get the chart title
    title = chart.title
    print("\nWorkbook chart title: " + title.text)
    
    # Get legend entries labels
    legend_entries_labels = chart.legend.get_legend_labels()
    for label in legend_entries_labels:
        print("\nWorkbook chart legend: " + label)
    
    # Get category axis title
    category_axis_title = chart.category_axis.title
    print("\nWorkbook category axis title: " + category_axis_title.text)
```

## **Output Generated by the Sample Code**

Console output from the sample code:

{{< highlight python >}}
Workbook chart title: Grafik Başlığı
Workbook chart legend: Artış
Workbook chart legend: Düşüş
Workbook chart legend: Toplam
Workbook category axis title: Eksen Başlığı
{{< /highlight >}}
