## **Find out if VBA Project is Protected in Python**

You can determine whether the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) project of your Excel file is protected using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET by using the [**VbaProject.is_protected**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/is_protected) property.

## **Sample Code**

The following sample code creates a workbook and then checks whether its VBA project is protected. It then protects the VBA project and checks again whether the VBA project is protected. Please see the console output for reference. Before protection, [**VbaProject.is_protected**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/is_protected) returns **false**, but after protection, it returns **true**.
