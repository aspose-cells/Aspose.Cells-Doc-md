You can check if your VBA project is signed or not using Microsoft Excel via **Tools > Digital Signatures...** menu command. Similarly, you can check it programmatically using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET [**Workbook.vba_project.is_signed**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/is_signed) property.
