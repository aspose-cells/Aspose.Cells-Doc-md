## Check if VBA Project is Protected and Locked for Viewing in Python

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET allows you to check if the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) project of an Excel file is protected and locked for viewing. For this, the API provides the [**VbaProject.islocked_for_viewing**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/islocked_for_viewing/) property. If it is locked for viewing, then the [**VbaProject.islocked_for_viewing**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/islocked_for_viewing/) property returns **true**.

## **Sample Code**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](43352065.xlsm) and checks if the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) project of an Excel file is protected and locked for viewing. Please also see its console output for reference.
