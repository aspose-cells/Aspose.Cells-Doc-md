Removing duplicate rows is one of Microsoft Excel's many useful features. It allows users to remove duplicate rows in a Worksheet; you can pick which columns should be checked for duplicate information.

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Cells.remove_duplicates()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/remove_duplicates/) method for this purpose. You can also set `startRow`, `startColumn`, `endRow`, and `endColumn` to specify the columns.

Following are the sample files which can be downloaded for testing this feature:
