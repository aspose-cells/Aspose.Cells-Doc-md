[Copy Range Data Only](/cells/python-net/copy-range-data-only/) and [Copy Range Data with Style](/cells/python-net/copy-range-data-with-style/) explain how to copy data from one range to another, either by itself or together with formatting. It is also possible to copy only the formatting. This article shows how.

3. Apply the style formatting to the range.  
4. Create a second range of cells.
