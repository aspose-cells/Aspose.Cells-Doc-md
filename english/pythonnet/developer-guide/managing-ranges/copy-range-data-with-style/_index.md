Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides a range of classes and methods for working with ranges, for example, [**create_range(upper_left_cell, lower_right_cell)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/create_range/#str-str), [**StyleFlag**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/styleflag) and [**apply_style(style, flag)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/apply_style/#aspose.cells.Style-aspose.cells.StyleFlag).

This example:

1. Creates a workbook.
1. Fills a number of cells in the first worksheet with data.
1. Creates a [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range).
1. Creates a [**Style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/style) object with specified formatting attributes.
1. Applies the style to the data range.
1. Creates a second range of cells.
