## **Cut and Paste Cells**

Aspose.Cells provides you with the ability to cut and paste cells within a worksheet by using the [**insert_cut_cells **](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/insert_cut_cells/) method of the [**Cells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells) collection. The [**insert_cut_cells **](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/insert_cut_cells/) accepts the following parameters.

- [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range): The range of cells to be cut.
- Row Index: The index of the row to insert cells.
- Column Index: The index of the column to insert cells.
- [**ShiftType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/shifttype): The shift direction of the columns.
