Sometimes a user needs to copy row heights of a source range to a destination range. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pastetype) enum for this purpose. When you set [**PasteOptions.paste_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pasteoptions/paste_type/) property with the [**PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pastetype) enum, the heights of all rows inside the source range will be copied to the destination range.

The following sample code demonstrates how to use the [**PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pastetype) enum to copy row heights from the source range to the destination range. Once you open the output Excel file generated by this code in Microsoft Excel, you will see that the destination range row heights are exactly the same as the source range row heights.
