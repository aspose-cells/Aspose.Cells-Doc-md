Sometime user needs to copy row heights of source range to destination range. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pastetype) enum for this purpose. When you will set [**PasteOptions.paste_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pasteoptions/paste_type/) property with [**PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pastetype) enum then heights of all rows inside the source range will be copied to destination range.
