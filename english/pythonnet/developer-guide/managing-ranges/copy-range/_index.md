## **Introduction**

In Excel, you can select a range, copy the range, then paste it with specific options to the same worksheet, other worksheets or other files.

## **Copy Ranges Using Aspose.Cells for Python Excel Library**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides some overload [**Range.copy**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/copy/#aspose.cells.Range) methods to copy the range.
And [**Range.copy_style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/copy_style/#aspose.cells.Range) only the copy style of the range; [**Range.copy_data**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/copy_data/#aspose.cells.Range) only the copy value of the range

## **Copy Range**

Creating two ranges: the source range, the target range, then copying source range to target range with [**Range.copy**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/copy/#aspose.cells.Range) method.
