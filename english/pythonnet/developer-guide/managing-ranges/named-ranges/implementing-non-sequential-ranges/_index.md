## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Normally, named ranges are rectangular with cells continuous and adjacent to each other. But sometimes, you may need to use a non-sequential cell range in which cells are not adjacent. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET supports creating a named range with non-adjacent cells.

## **How to Add Non-Sequential Ranges Using Aspose.Cells for Python Excel Library**

The code sample below shows how to create a named non-sequential range with Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
