## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to merge or split a range of cells. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Range.merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/merge/#) and [**Range.un_merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/un_merge/#) methods for this purpose. This article explains how to merge a range of cells into a single cell.


## **How to Merge or Unmerge Range of Cells**

The following sample code first creates a range - A1:D4 - then merges the cells in the range into a single cell using the [**Range.merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/merge/#) method. Similarly, you can split cells by creating a range and calling the [**Range.un_merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/un_merge/#) method.
