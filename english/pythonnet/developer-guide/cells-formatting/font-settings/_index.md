The look and feel of a text can be controlled by changing font settings. The font settings may include the name, style, size, color and other effects of the fonts. Just like Microsoft Excel, Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also supports configuring the font settings of the cells.

## **Configuring Font Settings**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides a class, [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook) that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook) class contains a [**worksheets**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/worksheets) collection that allows access to each worksheet in an Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class. The [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class provides a [**cells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/cells) collection. Each item in the [**cells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cells/) collection represents an object of the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell) class.

Aspose.Cells provides the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell) class' [**get_style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_style) and [**set_style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/set_style) methods which are used to get and set a cell's formatting style. The [**Style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/style) class provides properties for configuring font settings.

### **Setting Font Name**

Developers can apply any font to text inside a cell by using the [**Style.font**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/style/font) object's [Name](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/font/properties/name) property.

### **Setting Font Style to Bold**

Developers can make text bold by setting the [**Style.font**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/style/font) object's [**is_bold**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/font/is_bold) property to **true**.

### **Setting Font Color**

Use the [**Style.font**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/style/font) object's [**color**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/font/color) property to set the font color. Select any color from the Color enumeration (part of the .NET framework) and assign it to the [**color**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/font/color) property.
