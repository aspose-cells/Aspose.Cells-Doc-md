**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they differ by [**FormatCondition.color_scale.is_3_color_scale**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/colorscale/is_3_color_scale) property. This property is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
