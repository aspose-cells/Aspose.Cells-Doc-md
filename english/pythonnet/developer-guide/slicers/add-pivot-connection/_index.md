## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

If you want to associate a slicer with a PivotTable in Excel, you need to right‑click the slicer and select the **“Report Connections…”** item. In the option list, you can use the check box. Similarly, if you want to associate a slicer with a PivotTable using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API programmatically, please use the [**Slicer.add_pivot_connection(pivot)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/add_pivot_connection/#aspose.cells.pivot.PivotTable) method. It will associate the slicer with the PivotTable.

## **How to Associate Slicer and PivotTable Using Aspose.Cells for Python Excel Library**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](add-pivot-connection.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It accesses the slicer and then associates the slicer with the PivotTable. Finally, it saves the workbook as [output Excel file](add-pivot-connection-out.xlsx).
