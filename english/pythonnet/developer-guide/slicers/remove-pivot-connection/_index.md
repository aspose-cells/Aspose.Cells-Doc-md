## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

If you want to disassociate slicer and pivot table in Excel, you need to right-click slicer and select "Report Connections..." item. In the option list, you can operate on the check box. Similarly, if you want to disassociate slicer and pivot table using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API programmatically, please use the [**Slicer.remove_pivot_connection(pivot)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/remove_pivot_connection/#aspose.cells.pivot.PivotTable) method. It will disassociate slicer and pivot table.

## **Disassociate slicer and pivot table**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](remove-pivot-connection.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It accesses the slicers and then disassociates slicer and pivot table. Finally, it saves the workbook as [output Excel file](remove-pivot-connection-out.xlsx).
