## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can format the slicer in Microsoft Excel by setting its number of columns or by setting its style etc. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also allows you to do this using the [**Slicer.number_of_columns**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/number_of_columns/) and [**Slicer.style_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/style_type/) properties.

## **Formatting Slicer**

Please see the following code, it loads the [sample Excel file](67338473.xlsx) that contains a slicer. It accesses the slicer and sets its number of columns and style type and saves it as [output Excel file](67338474.xlsx). The screenshot shows how the slicer looks after the execution of the sample code.
