## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can format the slicer in Microsoft Excel by setting its number of columns or by setting its style etc. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also allows you to do this using the [**Slicer.number_of_columns**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/number_of_columns/) and [**Slicer.style_type**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/style_type/) properties.
