You may also make the property optional by setting the [**ContentTypeProperty.is_nillable**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypeproperty/is_nillable) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
