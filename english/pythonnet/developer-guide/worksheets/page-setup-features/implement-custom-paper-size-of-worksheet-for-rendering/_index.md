## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

There is no direct option available to create custom paper sizes in MS Excel; however, you can set a custom paper size for your desired worksheets when rendering an Excel file to PDF format. This document explains how to set a custom paper size of a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET APIs.

## **Implement Custom Paper Size of Worksheet for Rendering**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET allows you to set a custom paper size for the worksheet. You may use the [**custom_paper_size**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup/custom_paper_size/#float-float) method of the [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup) class to specify a custom page size. The following sample code illustrates how to specify a custom paper size for the first worksheet in the workbook. Please also see the [output PDF](45056028.pdf) generated with the following code for reference.
