When you set Page Setup Scaling using **Fit to n page(s) wide by m tall** option, Microsoft Excel calculates the Page Setup Scaling Factor. You can calculate the same thing using [**SheetRender.page_scale**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/page_scale) property. This property returns a double value which can be converted to percentage value. For example, if it returns 0.5 then it means scaling factor is 50%.
