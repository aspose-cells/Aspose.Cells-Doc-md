## **How to Set Margins**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides a class, [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook), that represents an Excel file. The [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook) class contains the [**worksheets**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/worksheets) collection that allows access to each worksheet in the Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class.

The [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class provides the [**page_setup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/page_setup/) property used to set the page setup options for a worksheet. The [**page_setup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/page_setup) attribute is an object of the [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup) class that enables developers to set different page layout options for a printed worksheet. The [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup) class provides various properties and methods used to set page setup options.
