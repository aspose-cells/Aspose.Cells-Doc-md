## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When you add a new sheet to a workbook, it contains the default *Page Setup settings*. There may be times when you need to transfer the settings ([**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup)) from one worksheet to another worksheet. This document explains how to copy Page Setup settings from one worksheet to another using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET APIs.

## **Copy Page Setup Settings from Source Worksheet into Destination Worksheet**

The following sample code illustrates how to copy *Page Setup settings* from one worksheet to another using [**PageSetup.copy()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup/copy/#aspose.cells.PageSetup-aspose.cells.CopyOptions) method. Please see the following sample code and its console output for a reference.
