Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of the cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell.get_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_characters/#) and [**Cell.set_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/set_characters/#list) methods. These methods will return and accept the array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects which you can use to access and update various properties of font like font name, font color, boldness, etc.

## **Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell**

The following code demonstrates the usage of [**Cell.get_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_characters/#) and [**Cell.set_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/set_characters/#list) methods using the [source excel file](5112369.xlsx) which you can download from the provided link. The source excel file has a rich text in the cell A1. It has 3 portions and each portion has a different font. The following code snippet accesses these portions and updates the first portion with a new font name. Finally, it saves the workbook as [output excel file](5112366.xlsx). When you will open it, you will find the font of the first portion of the text has changed to **"Arial"**.
