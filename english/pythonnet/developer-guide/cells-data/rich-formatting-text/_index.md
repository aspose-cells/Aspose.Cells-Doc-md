Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of a cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell.get_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_characters/#) and [**Cell.set_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/set_characters/#list) methods. These methods return and accept an array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects, which you can use to access and update various font properties such as font name, font color, boldness, etc.

## **Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell**

The following code demonstrates the usage of [**Cell.get_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_characters/#) and [**Cell.set_characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/set_characters/#list) methods using the source Excel file (5112369.xlsx), which you can download from the provided link. The source Excel file contains rich text in cell A1. It has three portions, and each portion has a different font. The following code snippet accesses these portions and updates the first portion with a new font name. Finally, it saves the workbook as the output Excel file (5112366.xlsx). When you open it, you will see that the font of the first portion of the text has changed to **"Arial"**.
