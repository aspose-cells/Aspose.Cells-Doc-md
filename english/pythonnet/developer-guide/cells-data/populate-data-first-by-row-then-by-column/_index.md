Populating a spreadsheet with data first by row and then by column improves the overall performance.

{{% /alert %}} 

Putting data in the sequence A1, B1, A2, B2 is faster than A1, A2, B1, B2. If there are many cells in a worksheet and you follow the second sequence, that is, you're filling the data row by row, this tip can make the program much faster.
