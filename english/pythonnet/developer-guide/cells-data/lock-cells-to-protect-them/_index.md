## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Locking cells to protect them is a common practice in spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, for several important reasons:

1. Preventing Accidental Changes: Locking cells can prevent users from accidentally modifying important data or formulas.
2. Maintaining Data Integrity: Ensure critical data remains consistent and accurate.
3. Controlled Access: Manage editing permissions in collaborative environments.
4. Protecting Formulas: Safeguard crucial calculations from alteration.
5. Enforcing Business Rules: Comply with data protection requirements.
6. Guiding Users: Provide clear editable areas in complex spreadsheets.

## **How to Lock Cells to Protect Them in Excel**
Here's how you can lock cells in Microsoft Excel:

1. Select the Cells to Lock: Choose cells or skip to lock entire sheet.
1. Open the Format Cells Dialog: Right-click > "Format Cells" or Ctrl+1.

## **How to Lock Cells to Protect Them Using Python**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET enables programmatic cell protection. Follow these steps:
1. Load [sample file](sample.xlsx)
2. Unlock all cells (default locked state is not enforced until protection)
3. Lock specific cells
4. Protect worksheet to enforce locking

```python
import aspose.cells as ac

# Load sample workbook
workbook = ac.Workbook("sample.xlsx")
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

# Unlock all cells first
style = ac.Style()
style.is_locked = False
style_flag = ac.StyleFlag()
style_flag.locked = True
worksheet.cells.apply_style(style, style_flag)

# Lock specific cells
worksheet.cells["A1"].get_style().is_locked = True
worksheet.cells["B2"].get_style().is_locked = True

# Enable worksheet protection
worksheet.protect(ac.ProtectionType.ALL)

# Save protected workbook
workbook.save("output.xlsx")
```

## **Output Result**
This implementation locks specified cells (A1 and B2) while keeping others editable. Worksheet protection enforces these settings.

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook, ProtectionType, StyleFlag

# Load the Excel file
workbook = Workbook("sample.xlsx")

# Access the first worksheet
sheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

# Unlock all cells first
unlock_style = workbook.create_style()
unlock_style.is_locked = False

style_flag = StyleFlag()
style_flag.locked = True
sheet.cells.apply_style(unlock_style, style_flag)

# Lock specific cells (A1 and B2)
lock_style = workbook.create_style()
lock_style.is_locked = True

sheet.cells.get("A1").set_style(lock_style)
sheet.cells.get("B2").set_style(lock_style)

# Protect the worksheet to enforce locking
sheet.protect(ProtectionType.ALL)

# Save the modified workbook
workbook.save("output_locked.xlsx")
```
