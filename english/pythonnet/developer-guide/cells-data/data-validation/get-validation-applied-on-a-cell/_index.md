You can use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to get the validation applied to a cell. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Cell.get_validation()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_validation/) method for this purpose. If there is no validation applied on the cell, it returns null.

Similarly, you can use [**Worksheet.validations.get_validation_in_cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validationcollection/get_validation_in_cell/#int-int) method to acquire the validation applied to a cell by providing its row and column indices.
