## **Get Hyperlinks in Range**

The [**Range**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range) class provides a [**hyperlinks**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/range/hyperlinks/) property which returns all the hyperlinks in the selected range. You may also delete the Hyperlink by calling the [**Hyperlink.delete**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/hyperlink/delete/#) method.
