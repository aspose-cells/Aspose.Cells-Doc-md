Sometimes the value of the data is hidden because it is formatted in some way. For example, suppose cell D4 has formula =Sum(A1:A2) and its value is 20 but it is formatted as ---, then the value 20 is hidden and cannot be found using Microsoft Excel find options. However, you can find it using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET using [**LookInType.ORIGINAL_VALUES**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/lookintype).

The following sample code illustrates the above point. It finds cell D4 which cannot be found using Microsoft Excel find options but Aspose.Cells can find it using [**LookInType.ORIGINAL_VALUES**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/lookintype). Please read the comments inside the code for more information.
