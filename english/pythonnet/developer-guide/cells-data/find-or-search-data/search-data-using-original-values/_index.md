Sometimes the value of the data is hidden because it is formatted in some way. For example, suppose cell D4 has the formula `=SUM(A1:A2)` and its value is 20, but it is formatted as ---. In that case, the value 20 is hidden and cannot be found using Microsoft Excel's Find options. However, you can find it using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET with **LookInType.ORIGINAL_VALUES**.

The following sample code illustrates the above point. It finds cell D4, which cannot be found using Microsoft Excel's Find options, but Aspose.Cells can locate it using **LookInType.ORIGINAL_VALUES**. Please read the comments inside the code for more information.
