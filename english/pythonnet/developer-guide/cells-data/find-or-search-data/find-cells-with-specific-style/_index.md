Sometimes, you need to find cells with a particular style applied. You can use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to find all cells with a common style. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**FindOptions.style**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/findoptions/style/) property, which you can use to specify the style to search for.

The code in this example finds all cells that have the same style as that of cell A1. After the code has been executed, all the cells that have the same style as A1 contain the text "Found".
