In Excel, R1C1 and A1 are two different reference styles used to identify cells in a worksheet. Note that the choice between A1 and R1C1 is largely a matter of personal preference. Most users are more familiar with A1 style, but R1C1 can be useful in certain situations, especially when working with formulas and calculations.

## **A1 Reference Style**

This is the default reference style in Excel. In A1 style, columns are identified by letters (A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., ZZ, AAA, AAB, ...), and rows are identified by numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
For example, the cell in the first column and second row is referred to as A2.

## **R1C1 Reference Style**

In R1C1 style, both rows and columns are identified by numbers. The letter "R" represents the row number, and the letter "C" represents the column number. For example, R2C1 refers to the cell in the second row and first column.

Any numbers in square brackets refer to relative distance from the current cell. Unlike A1 which refers to columns followed by row number, R1C1 does the opposite: rows followed by columns (which does take some getting used to). Positive numbers will refer to cells below and/or across to the right. Negative numbers will refer to cells above and/or to the left.

For example R[2]C[3] is a cell 2 rows down and 3 columns to the right. R[-1]C[-4] is a cell 1 row up and 4 columns to the left. If no number is shown in brackets then you are referring to the same row or column i.e. R[3]C will be a cell 3 rows below the current cell in the same column.
