## **Get Text Width of Cell Value**

Sometimes, the developers might need to calculate the width of the cell's value for arranging data in some layout. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**CellsHelper.get_text_width**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cellshelper/get_text_width/#str-aspose.cells.Font-float) method which allows developers to get the text width of the cell's value. The following sample code illustrates how to use [**CellsHelper.get_text_width**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cellshelper/get_text_width/#str-aspose.cells.Font-float) to access the text width of the cell's value.
