Sometimes you need to calculate the width and height of a cell value to fit the value inside the cell. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Cell.get_width_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_width_of_value/#) and [**Cell.get_height_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_height_of_value/#) methods for this purpose. By using these methods you can calculate the width and height of the cell value, then set the column width and row height of that cell respectively, and this will adjust the cell value to fit inside the cell.  

Alternatively, you can also autofit rows and columns of your cells or a range of cells using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET APIs.
