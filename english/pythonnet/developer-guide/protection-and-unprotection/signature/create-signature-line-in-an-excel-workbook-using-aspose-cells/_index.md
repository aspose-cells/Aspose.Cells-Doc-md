## **Introduction**

Microsoft Excel provides a feature to add a **Signature Line** in Excel workbooks. You can add a signature line by clicking the **Insert** tab and then selecting **Signature Line** from the **Text** group.

## **How to Create Signature Line for Excel**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also provides this feature and has exposed the [**Picture.signature_line**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/signature_line) property for this purpose. This article will explain how to use this property to add a signature line using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.

The following sample code adds a signature line using the [**Picture.signature_line**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/signature_line) property and saves the workbook.
