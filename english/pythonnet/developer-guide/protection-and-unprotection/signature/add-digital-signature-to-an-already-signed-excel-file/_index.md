## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Workbook.add_digital_signature**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/add_digital_signature) method that you can use to add a digital signature to an already signed Excel file.

Please note that while adding a digital signature to an already signed Excel document, if the original document is an Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET‑generated document, it works correctly. However, if the original document is generated by other engines (e.g., Microsoft Excel, etc.), Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET cannot keep the file unchanged after loading and re‑saving it, which will invalidate the original signature.
