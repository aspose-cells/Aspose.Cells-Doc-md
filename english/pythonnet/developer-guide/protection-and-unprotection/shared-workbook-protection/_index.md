## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can protect or unprotect the shared workbook with Microsoft Excel as shown in the following screenshot. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also supports this feature with the [**Workbook.protect_shared_workbook()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/protect_shared_workbook) and [**Workbook.unprotect_shared_workbook()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/unprotect_shared_workbook) methods.

## **Password Protect or Unprotect the Shared Workbook**
