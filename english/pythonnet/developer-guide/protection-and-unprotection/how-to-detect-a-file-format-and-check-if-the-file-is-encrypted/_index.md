Sometimes you need to detect a file's format before opening it because the file extension does not guarantee that the file content is appropriate. The file might be encrypted (a password-protected file) so it can't be read it directly, or we should not read it. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**FileFormatUtil.detect_file_format()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fileformatutil/detect_file_format) static method and some relevant APIs that you can use to process documents.

The following sample code illustrates how to detect a file format (using the file path) and check its extension. You can also determine whether the file is encrypted.
