## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When you share a workbook, you get an option saying ***Keep change history for N days*** as shown in the following screenshot. You can update the number of days for preserving history using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET with [**WorksheetCollection.revision_logs.days_preserving_history**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.revisions/revisionlogcollection/days_preserving_history) property.
