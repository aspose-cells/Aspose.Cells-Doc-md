You can use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to set AutoRecover property of workbook. The default value of this property is **true**. When you set it **false** on a workbook, Microsoft Excel disables AutoRecover (Autosave) on that Excel file.

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Workbook.settings.auto_recover**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/auto_recover) property to enable or disable this option.

The following code explains how to use  [**Workbook.settings.auto_recover**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/auto_recover)Â property of the workbook. The code first reads the default value of this property which is **true**, then it sets it as **false** and saves the workbook. Then it reads the workbook again and reads the value of this property which is **false** at this time.
