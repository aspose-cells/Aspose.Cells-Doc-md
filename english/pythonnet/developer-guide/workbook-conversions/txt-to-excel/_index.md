## **Opening CSV Files**

Comma Separated Values (CSV) files contain records where the values are separated by commas. Data is stored as a table where each column is separated by the comma character and quoted by the double quote character. If a field value contains a double quote character it is escaped with a pair of double quote characters. You can also use Microsoft Excel to export spreadsheet data to CSV.

## **Opening CSV Files and Replacing Invalid Characters**

In Excel, when a CSV file with special characters is opened, the characters are automatically replaced. The same is done by the Aspose.Cells API, as demonstrated in the code example below.

## **Opening Tab Delimited Files**

Tab‑delimited (text) files contain spreadsheet data but without any formatting. Data is arranged in rows and columns like in tables and spreadsheets. Basically, a tab‑delimited file is a special kind of plain text file with a tab between each column.

## **Opening Tab‑Separated Values (TSV) Files**

Tab‑separated values (TSV) files contain spreadsheet data but without any formatting. They are the same as tab‑delimited files, where data is arranged in rows and columns like in tables and spreadsheets.
