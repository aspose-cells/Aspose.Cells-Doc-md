PDF logical structure facilities provide a mechanism for incorporating information, regarding the document content structure, into a PDF file. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET preserves information about the structure from a Microsoft Excel document, such as cell, row, table, worksheet, image, shape, header/footer, etc.

With option [PdfSaveOptions.export_document_structure]https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions/export_document_structure/), you can save to a tagged PDF with document structure exported.
