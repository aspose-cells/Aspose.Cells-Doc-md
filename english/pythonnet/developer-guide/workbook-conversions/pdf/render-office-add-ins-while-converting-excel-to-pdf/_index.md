## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Earlier, Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET could not render Office Add-Ins when Excel file is saved to PDF format. Now Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET renders it fine. You do not need to use any special method or property to render Office Add-Ins in output PDF. Just save your Excel file to PDF format and it will render Office Add-Ins.

## **Render Office Add-Ins while converting Excel to PDF**

The following sample code saves the [sample Excel file](60489769.xlsx) which contains the Office Add-Ins. Please see the [output PDF generated with the previous version i.e. 17.11](60489770.pdf) and the [output PDF generated with newer version i.e. 17.12 and onward](60489771.pdf). The previous version output PDF is blank but the newer version output PDF shows the Office Add-In.
