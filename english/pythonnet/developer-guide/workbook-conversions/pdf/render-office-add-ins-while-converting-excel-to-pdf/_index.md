## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

Earlier, Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET could not render Office Add-Ins when an Excel file is saved to PDF format. Now Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET renders them correctly. You do not need to use any special method or property to render Office Add-Ins in the output PDF. Just save your Excel file to PDF format and it will render the Office Add-Ins.  

## **Render Office Add-Ins while converting Excel to PDF**  

The following sample code processes the [sample Excel file](60489769.xlsx) that contains Office Add-Ins. Please see the [output PDF generated with the previous version, i.e., 17.11](60489770.pdf) and the [output PDF generated with the newer version, i.e., 17.12 and onward](60489771.pdf). The previous‑version PDF is blank, but the newer‑version PDF shows the Office Add‑Ins.
