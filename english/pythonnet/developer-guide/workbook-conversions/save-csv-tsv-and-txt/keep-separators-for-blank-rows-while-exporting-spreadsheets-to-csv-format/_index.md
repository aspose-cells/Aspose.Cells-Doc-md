## **Keep Separators for Blank Rows while exporting spreadsheets to CSV format**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the ability to keep line separators while converting spreadsheets to CSV format. For this, You may use the [**keep_separators_for_blank_row**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/keep_separators_for_blank_row/) property of [**TxtSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/) class. [**keep_separators_for_blank_row**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/keep_separators_for_blank_row/) is a boolean property. To keep the separators for blank lines while converting the Excel File to CSV, set the [**keep_separators_for_blank_row**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/keep_separators_for_blank_row/) property to **true**.

The following sample code loads the [source Excel file](84378743.xlsx). It sets [**keep_separators_for_blank_row**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/keep_separators_for_blank_row/) property to **true** and saves it as [output.csv](84378744.csv). The screenshot shows the comparison between the source Excel file, the default output generated while converting the spreadsheet to CSV and the output generated by setting [**keep_separators_for_blank_row**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/txtsaveoptions/keep_separators_for_blank_row/) to **true**.
