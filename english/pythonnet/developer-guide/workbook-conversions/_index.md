## **Converting Excel Workbook to XPS**

The XPS document format consists of structured XML markup that defines the layout of a document and the visual appearance of each page, along with rendering rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, processing, and printing documents.

The markup language for XPS is a subset of XAML which allows it to incorporate vector graphics elements in documents, using XAML to mark up the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) primitives. The elements used are described in terms of paths and other geometrical primitives.

An XPS file is, in fact, a unicode ZIP archive using the Open Packaging Conventions, containing the files which make up the document. These include an XML markup file for each page, text, embedded fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application that supports ZIP files.

- [**smoothing_mode**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/smoothing_mode/): Specifies the anti-aliasing for lines, curves & edges of filled areas.
- [**text_rendering_hint**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/text_rendering_hint/): Specifies the quality of text rendering.
- [**quality**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/quality/): Specifies the quality of the image between 0 to 100, when [**ImageType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/imagetype/) is specified as Jpeg.
- [**vertical_resolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/vertical_resolution/): Gets or sets the vertical resolution of the image in dots per inch.
- [**horizontal_resolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/horizontal_resolution/): Gets or sets the horizontal resolution of the image in dots per inch.
- [**tiff_compression**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/tiff_compression/): Gets or sets the compression type for the images when [**ImageType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/imagetype/) is specified as Tiff.
- [**transparent**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/transparent/): Indicates if the background of an image should be transparent when ImageFormat is specified as Png.

The code below demonstrates how to use [**HtmlSaveOptions.image_options**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/image_options/) to specify different preferences.
