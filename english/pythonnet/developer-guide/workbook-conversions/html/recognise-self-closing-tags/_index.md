HTML can have a variety of tag formatting for empty tags, such as `<td></td>` or `<td/>`. Aspose.Cells supports both of these formats now, whereas earlier it supported only `<td></td>`‑style tags. This feature can be tested by converting the attached sample HTML file to an Excel file. The sample HTML file and output Excel file can be downloaded from the following links for testing.
