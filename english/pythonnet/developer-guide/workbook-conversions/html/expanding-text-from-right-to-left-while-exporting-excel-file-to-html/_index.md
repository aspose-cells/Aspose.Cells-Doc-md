Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET now supports expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML. This feature has been implemented since the v8.9.0.0. Now if your source excel file contains any text which expands from right to left, then Aspose.Cells will export it to HTML correctly.
