## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  

Instead of adjusting filters to show dates, you can use a PivotTable Timeline — a dynamic filter option that lets you easily filter by date/time and zoom in on the period you want with a slider control. Microsoft Excel allows you to create a timeline by selecting a pivot table and then clicking *Insert > Timeline*. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also allows you to create a timeline using the [**Worksheet.timelines.add()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.timelines/timelinecollection/#methods) method.  

## **How to Create a Timeline for a Pivot Table Using Aspose.Cells for Python Excel Library**  

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](input.xlsx) that contains the pivot table. It then creates the timeline based on the first base pivot field. Finally, it saves the workbook in [output XLSX](output.xlsx) format. The following screenshot shows the timeline created by Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET in the output Excel file.
