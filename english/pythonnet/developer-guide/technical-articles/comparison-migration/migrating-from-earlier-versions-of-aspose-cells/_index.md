**Migration Notice:** This guide helps developers transition existing implementations from Aspose.Cells legacy versions to the latest Python.NET API while maintaining backward compatibility.

## **Key Migration Considerations**
When upgrading to the latest Python.NET version of Aspose.Cells, observe these fundamental changes:

1. **Namespace Updates**  
   All classes now reside under `aspose.cells` module instead of nested .NET namespaces. Update imports using:
   ```python
   import aspose.cells as ac
   ```

2. **Method Signature Changes**  
   Methods follow Python naming conventions (snake_case) instead of PascalCase:
   ```python
   # Legacy .NET style
   workbook.Save("output.xlsx")

   # Python.NET style
   workbook.save("output.xlsx")
   ```

3. **Property Access**  
   Use Python property decorators instead of getter/setter methods:
   ```python
   worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
   worksheet.cells.get(0, 0).value = "New Value"
   ```

4. **Collection Handling**  
   Use Python iterables instead of IEnumerable:
   ```python
   for sheet in workbook.worksheets:
       print(sheet.name)
   ```

## **Backward Compatibility**
The Python.NET API maintains functional parity with these exceptions:
- Removed legacy methods marked obsolete in v20.6+
- Threading models follow Python's GIL constraints
- Memory management uses Python's garbage collection

## **Migration Checklist**
1. Update package reference in requirements.txt:
   ```
   aspose-cells-python>=23.8
   ```
2. Replace all `using` statements with Python imports
3. Convert method calls to snake_case
4. Update collection operations to Python syntax
5. Test file I/O operations with Python path handling
