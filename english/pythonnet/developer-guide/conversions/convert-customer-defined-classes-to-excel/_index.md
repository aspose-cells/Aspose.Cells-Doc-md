## **Convert Customer Defined Class to Excel**
Sometimes, we have a collection of classes, and if we want to import class information into an Excel file, a convenient solution is to use Python's reflection mechanism to include both the class data and the names of its member variables, without needing to know the class's specific metadata in advance.
Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to import data from a user-defined class list into an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET:
The file ImportCustomObject.py defines the class information to be imported and uses Python's reflection mechanism to include both the class data and member variable names into specific cell ranges.

The file TestImportCustomObject.py illustrates a simple use case. Users can refer to this example or make slight modifications to import their own data.
