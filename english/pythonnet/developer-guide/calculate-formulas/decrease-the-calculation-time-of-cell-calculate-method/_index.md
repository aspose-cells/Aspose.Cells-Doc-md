## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Normally, we recommend users to call [**workbook.calculate_formula()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/calculate_formula/) method once and then get the calculated values of individual cells. When working with single cell calculations, you can use [**calculation_options.recursive**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationoptions/recursive/) property to significantly reduce computation time. Setting this property to `False` prevents recalculating dependent cells on subsequent calls.

## **Optimizing Cell Calculation Performance**

The following sample demonstrates using the recursive property. Use the provided [sample Excel file](5113710.xlsx) to test the performance difference. The code shows how setting `recursive=False` reduces calculation time by avoiding redundant dependent cell recalculations.

```python
# For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-.NET
# Test calculation time after setting recursive true
test_calc_time_recursive(True)

# Test calculation time after setting recursive false
test_calc_time_recursive(False)
```

```python
import os
import time
from aspose.cells import Workbook, CalculationOptions

def test_calc_time_recursive(rec):
    """
    Tests calculation time with recursive option and prints elapsed seconds
    """
    # The path to the documents directory
    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    data_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "data")
    
    # Load sample workbook
    wb = Workbook(os.path.join(data_dir, "sample.xlsx"))
    
    # Access first worksheet
    ws = wb.worksheets[0]
    
    # Set calculation options
    opts = CalculationOptions()
    opts.recursive = rec
    
    # Start timing
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    # Calculate cell A1 one million times
    for _ in range(1000000):
        ws.cells.get("A1").calculate(opts)
    
    # Calculate elapsed time
    elapsed_time = int(time.perf_counter() - start_time)
    
    # Print results
    print(f"Recursive {rec}: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```

## **Performance Benchmark Results**

Typical output when running the optimized code with the sample file shows significant time reduction:
