## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Please use the **LoadOptions.load_filter** property when filtering data from the workbook. However, if you want to filter data from individual worksheets, you will need to override the **LoadFilter.start_sheet** method. Please provide an appropriate value from the **LoadDataFilterOptions** enumeration while creating or working with **LoadFilter**.

The **LoadDataFilterOptions** enumeration has the following possible values.

- All
- BookSettings
- CellBlank
- CellBool
- CellData
- CellError
- CellNumeric
- CellString
- CellValue
- Chart
- ConditionalFormatting
- DataValidation
- DefinedNames
- DocumentProperties
- Formula
- Hyperlinks
- MergedArea
- PivotTable
- Settings
- Shape
- SheetData
- SheetSettings
- Structure
- Style
- Table
- VBA
- XmlMap

## **Filter Objects while Loading a Workbook**
The following sample code illustrates how to filter charts from the workbook. Please check the **sample Excel file** (`5115258.xlsx`) used in this code and the **output PDF** (`5115257.pdf`) generated by it. As you can see in the output PDF, all charts have been filtered out of the workbook.
