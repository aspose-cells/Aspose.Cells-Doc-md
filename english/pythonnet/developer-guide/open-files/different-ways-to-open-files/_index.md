## **How to Open an Excel File via a Path**

Developers can open a Microsoft Excel file using its file path on the local computer by specifying it in the [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook) class constructor. Simply pass the path in the constructor as a *string*. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET will automatically detect the file format type.

## **How to Open an Excel File via a Stream**

It is also simple to open an Excel file as a stream. To do so, use an overloaded version of the constructor that takes the *Stream* object that contains the file.

## **How to Open a File with Data only**

To open a file with data only, use the [**LoadOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/loadoptions) and [**LoadFilter**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/loadfilter) classes to set the related attribute and options of the classes for the template file to be loaded.
