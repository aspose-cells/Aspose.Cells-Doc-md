## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

You can render a sequence of pages from your Excel file to images using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET with [**ImageOrPrintOptions.page_index**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/page_index) and [**ImageOrPrintOptions.page_count**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/page_count) properties. These properties are useful when there are many—e.g., thousands—pages in your worksheet but you want to render only some of them. This will not only save processing time but also reduce memory consumption during the rendering process.

## **Render Sequence of Pages using PageIndex and PageCount Properties of ImageOrPrintOptions**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](55541781.xlsx) and renders only pages 4, 5, 6 and 7 using the [**ImageOrPrintOptions.page_index**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/page_index) and [**ImageOrPrintOptions.page_count**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/page_count) properties. Here are the rendered pages generated by the code.
