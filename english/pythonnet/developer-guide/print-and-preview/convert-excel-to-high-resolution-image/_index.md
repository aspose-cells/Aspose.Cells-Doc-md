With the increasing prevalence of high-resolution screens, images generated at the default 96 DPI often appear blurry and unclear. To ensure clarity on high-resolution screens, it's essential to generate images at a higher DPI. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET offers the functionality to set [**ImageOrPrintOptions.horizontal_resolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/horizontal_resolution/) and [**ImageOrPrintOptions.vertical_resolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/vertical_resolution/), allowing you to create high-quality images from Excel files that look sharp on high-resolution displays.
