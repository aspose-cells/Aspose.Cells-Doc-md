With the increasing prevalence of high-resolution screens, images generated at the default 96 DPI often appear blurry and unclear. To ensure clarity on high-resolution screens, it's essential to generate images at a higher DPI. Aspose.Cells offers the functionality to set [**ImageOrPrintOptions.HorizontalResolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/horizontalresolution/) and [**ImageOrPrintOptions.VerticalResolution**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/verticalresolution/), allowing you to create high-quality images from Excel files that look sharp on high-resolution displays.
