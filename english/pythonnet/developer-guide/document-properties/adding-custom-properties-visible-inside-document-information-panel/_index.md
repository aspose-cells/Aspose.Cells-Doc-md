## **Adding Custom Properties visible inside Document Information Panel**

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET can be used to add custom properties inside the workbook object which are visible inside the Document Information Panel. You can open the Document Information Panel in Microsoft Excel using File > Info > Properties > Show Document Panel menu commands.

Please use [**Workbook.content_type_properties.add()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypepropertycollection/add)Â method to add a custom property which will be visible in the Document Information Panel

The following sample code adds two custom properties. The first property is without any type and the second property has a type as DateTime. Once, you will open the output Excel file generated by this code, you will see these two properties inside the Document Information Panel.
