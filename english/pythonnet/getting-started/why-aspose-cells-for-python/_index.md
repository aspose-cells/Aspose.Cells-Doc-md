### Add chart to Excel File Using pandas
In Pandas, you can use the `ExcelWriter` object and the `to_excel()` function to write data to an Excel file. However, please note that Pandas itself does not support embedding charts directly into Excel files; it can only write data. To add a chart, you need to use the `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter` library to manipulate the workbook. Here is an example of using the `xlsxwriter` library to add a chart to an Excel file.
