Following is the simple usage scenario.

**Java**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 //Create an instance of Workbook

Workbook book = new Workbook();

//Access first worksheet from the collection

Worksheet sheet = book.getWorksheets().get(0);

//Add Toggle Button ActiveX Control to the ShapeCollection at specified location

Shape shape = sheet.getShapes().addActiveXControl(ControlType.TOGGLE_BUTTON, 4, 0, 4, 0, 100, 30);

//Access the ActiveX Control object and set its linked cell property

ActiveXControl control = shape.getActiveXControl();

control.setLinkedCell("A1");

//Save the result on disc

book.save(dir + "output.xlsx", SaveFormat.XLSX);

For more details on this feature, please review the detailed article on [Load Spreadsheets with Specified Paper Size](/cells/java/load-workbook-with-specified-printer-paper-size/).

{{% /alert %}} 

Following is the simple usage scenario.

**Java**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 //Create an instance of LoadOptions

LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();

//Set the PaperSize property to appropriate value

loadOptions.setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_4);

//Create an instance of Workbook and load an existing spreadsheet

Workbook book = new Workbook(dir + "input.xlsx", loadOptions);

### **Added Cell.getCharacters(flag) Method**
Aspose.Cells APIs allow to get the characters objects in the form of FontSetting array by using the Cell.getCharacters method. With this release, the Aspose.Cells for Java API has exposed an overloaded version of the Cell.getCharacters that could accept Boolean as parameter, indicating if the table style has to be applied on the cell if the cell is part of a ListObject.

**Java**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 //Create an instance of Workbook and load an existing spreadsheet

Workbook book = new Workbook(dir + "input.xlsx");

//Access first worksheet from the collection

Worksheet sheet = book.getWorksheets().get(0);

//Access cells collection of the first worksheet

Cells cells = sheet.getCells();

//Access particular cell from a ListObject

//Assuming A1 resides in a ListObject

Cell cell = cells.get("A1");

//Get all Characters objects from the cell

FontSetting[] characters = cell.getCharacters(true);

{{< /highlight >}}
### **Added OleObject.AutoLoad Property**
Aspose.Cells for Java 8.8.3 has exposed the OleObject.AutoLoad property which allows to refresh the OleObject's image if the contents/data of the underlying object has been changed. The aforementioned property when set to true, forces the Excel application to refresh the OleObject's image when resultant spreadsheet is loaded.

OleObjectCollection oleObjects = sheet.getOleObjects();

//Access a OleObject from the collection

OleObject oleObject = oleObjects.get(0);

//Set AutoLoad to true

oleObject.setAutoLoad(true);
