## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Numbers is a spreadsheet application developed by Apple Inc. Aspose.Cells can read Numbers spreadsheets, but it does not support writing to them. It can read a Numbers spreadsheet's data, style, and formulas.

## **Read Numbers Spreadsheet Developed by Apple Inc. using Aspose.Cells**

The following sample code loads the [Sample Numbers Spreadsheet](sampleNumbersByAppleInc.numbers) and converts it to [Output PDF Format](outputNumbersByAppleInc.pdf). You will have to use the [**LoadOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/LoadOptions) class and specify [**LoadFormat.NUMBERS**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/loadformat#NUMBERS) as a parameter in its constructor to load it successfully. Please download both of them from the given links. You can try the code with any Numbers spreadsheet. Please also read the code comments for more help.
