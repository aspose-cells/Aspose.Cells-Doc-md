Sometimes, you want to access a worksheet from a chart's reference. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property which returns the reference of the worksheet that contains the chart.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property. The code first prints the name of the worksheet, then accesses the first chart on the worksheet. It then prints the worksheet name again, using the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property.
