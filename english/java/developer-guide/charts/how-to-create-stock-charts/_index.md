## **What is a stock chart?**

Stock charts are a specific type of chart used to track changes in the price of traded assets, such as commodities, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. They allow you to see high and low values over time, along with opening and closing values in a single chart. Aspose.Cells offers four stock charts, and to use them you must have the right set of data available and select the columns in the right order.

The set of data below shows the daily trading information for a stock. We are going to use this data to create each of the four stock charts available in Aspose.Cells.
