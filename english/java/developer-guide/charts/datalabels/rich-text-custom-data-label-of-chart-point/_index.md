You can use Aspose.Cells to create a **rich‑text custom data label for a chart point**. Aspose.Cells provides the [**DataLabels.characters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/datalabels#characters-int-int-) method to return the [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/FontSetting) object, which can be used to set the font properties of the text, such as its color, boldness, etc.
