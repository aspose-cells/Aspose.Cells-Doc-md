By default, when the chart is export to SVG format, the **viewBox** attribute is not included in its XML. However, Aspose.Cells provides [**ImageOrPrintOptions.setSVGFitToViewPort()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/imageorprintoptions#SVGFitToViewPort) property which when set to **true** exports the chart to SVG with viewBox attribute.

If you open the chart's SVG in notepad, you will find the **viewBox** attribute similar to this.
