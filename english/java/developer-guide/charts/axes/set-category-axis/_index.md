## **The steps in sample code**

1. Create a new workbook.  
2. Create a new chart in the first worksheet.  
3. Add some values to cells in the first worksheet.  
4. Now you can set the category axis. There are two ways: using cell data or using strings directly; both are shown in the sample code.  
5. Set the value axis and save the workbook to view the result.
