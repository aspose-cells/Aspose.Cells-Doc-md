## **Possible Usage Scenarios**  
Early versions of Aspose.Cells were not able to handle automatic units of chart axes properly when the chart was rendered to an image or PDF. Now, Aspose.Cells supports the handling of automatic units of chart axes. There is no code change. Just convert your chart into an image or PDF and it will render the chart axes just as Microsoft Excel renders them.  

## **Handle Automatic Units of Chart Axis like Microsoft Excel**  
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](61767769.xlsx) and generates the [output PDF chart](61767768.pdf). The screenshot shows the automatic units of chart axes in red rectangles and also compares the sample Excel file chart with the output PDF chart. Both are identical.
