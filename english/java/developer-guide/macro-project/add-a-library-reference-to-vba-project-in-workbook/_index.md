In Microsoft Excel, you can add a library reference to the VBA project by clicking the **Tools > References...** manually. It will open the following dialog box which will help you to select from existing references or browse your library yourself.

But sometimes, you need to add or register the library reference to the VBA project through code. You can do it using Aspose.Cells [**VbaProject.getReferences().addRegisteredReference()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/vbaprojectreferencecollection#addRegisteredReference(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)) method.
