Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape on a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.getLeftToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#LeftToCorner) and [**Shape.getTopToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#TopToCorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet in pixels.
