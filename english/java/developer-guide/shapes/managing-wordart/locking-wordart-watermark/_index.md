Aspose.Cells APIs allow adding WordArt watermarks on the worksheet in a way that the WordArt becomes an object that can be moved and positioned on the worksheet. It is also possible to lock the WordArt object for any interaction such as editing, movement, and selection. This article explains the usage of [**Shape.setLockedProperty**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#setLockedProperty-int-boolean-) method to lock several aspects of the watermark.
