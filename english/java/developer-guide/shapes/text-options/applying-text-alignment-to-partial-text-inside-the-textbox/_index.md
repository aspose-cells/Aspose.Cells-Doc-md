TextBoxes can improve the expressiveness of our documents and diagrams, and applying different alignments to different parts of a TextBox can help highlight points of interest to readers. But the default alignment of a TextBox does not meet all our needs. For this, you may need to adjust each TextBox to meet your target requirements. If you don't have a lot of TextBox objects to tweak, you're in luck. If there are many TextBoxes to adjust, you will be in trouble. Don't worry; Aspose.Cells provides an API to help you do just that.

The following sample code applies text alignment to a TextBox.

You can also change the text alignment of some text inside a TextBox shape using appropriate HTML. The following sample code applies text alignment to partial text inside the TextBox.
