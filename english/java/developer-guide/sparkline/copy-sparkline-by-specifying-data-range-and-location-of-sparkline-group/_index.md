Copy Sparkline by Specifying Data Range and Location of Sparkline Group in MS Excel

Microsoft Excel allows you to copy a Sparkline by specifying the Data Range and Location of Sparkline Group. Follow these steps to copy your Sparkline to other cells.

- Select the cell containing your Sparkline.
- Select **Edit Data** from the **Sparkline** section inside the **Design** tab
- Choose **Edit Group Location & Data...**
- Specify Data Range and Location and click OK.

## Example

Aspose.Cells provides the [**SparklineCollection.add(dataRange, row, column)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/SparklineCollection) method to specify the Data Range and Location of Sparkline Group.

### Screenshots of the source and output files

The following screenshot shows the source Excel file used inside the code. The red highlighted area shows "**Edit Group Location & Data...**" option to specify the data range and location of the sparkline group. The cell P4 shows the sparkline which will be copied to the other four cells filled with yellow color using Aspose.Cells.
