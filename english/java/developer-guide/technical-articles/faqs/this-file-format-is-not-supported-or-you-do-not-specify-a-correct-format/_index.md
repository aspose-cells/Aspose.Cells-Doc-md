## **This file format is not supported or you do not specify a correct format**
If user has specified the file format when creating workbook from template file, commonly this error is because the specified file format is not the actual file format of the template file. If user has not specified the file format, commonly it is because that the file name extension does not represent the actual file format of this file and the file format cannot be detected automatically, such as the csv/tsv file which has no any special identifiers.
