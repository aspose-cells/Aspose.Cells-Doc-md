You can assign a **Password to open** and a **Password to modify** while creating your workbooks in Microsoft Excel. Please see this screenshot which shows the interface Microsoft Excel provides to specify these passwords.

Sometimes, you need to check if the given password matches the **Password to modify** programmatically. Aspose.Cells provides the [**workbook.getSettings().getWriteProtection().validatePassword()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/writeprotection#validatePassword-java.lang.String-) method, which you can use to check whether the given password to modify is correct.
