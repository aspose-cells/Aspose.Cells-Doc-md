Aspose.Cells provides **support** for signing workbooks with XAdES **signatures**. For this, the API provides the [**DigitalSignature**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/DigitalSignature) class and the [**XAdESType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/XAdESType) enumeration.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [**DigitalSignature**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/DigitalSignature) class to sign the **source workbook** (`sourceFile.xlsx`).
