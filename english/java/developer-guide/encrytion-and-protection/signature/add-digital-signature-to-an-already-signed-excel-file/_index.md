## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Aspose.Cells provides the [**Workbook.addDigitalSignature(DigitalSignatureCollection digitalSignatureCollection)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#addDigitalSignature-com.aspose.cells.DigitalSignatureCollection-) method that you can use to add a digital signature to an already signed Excel file.

Please note: while adding a digital signature to an already signed Excel document, if the original document is an Aspose.Cells‑generated document, it works well. However, if the original document is generated by other engines (e.g., Microsoft Excel, etc.), Aspose.Cells cannot keep the file unchanged after loading and re‑saving it; this will make the original signature invalid.
