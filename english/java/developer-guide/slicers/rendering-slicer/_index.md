## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells supports the rendering of slicer shape. If you convert your worksheet into an image or you save your workbook to PDF or HTML formats, you will see, slicers are rendered properly.
## **Rendering Slicer**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](67338485.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It converts the worksheet into an image by setting the print area that covers only the slicer. The flowing image is the [output image](67338486.png) that shows the rendered slicer. As you can see, the slicer has been rendered properly it looks the same as in the sample Excel file.
