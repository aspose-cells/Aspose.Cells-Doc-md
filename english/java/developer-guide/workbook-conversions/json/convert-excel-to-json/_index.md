## **How to Convert Excel Workbook to JSON**

No need to wonder how to convert an Excel workbook to JSON, because the Aspose.Cells Java library provides the best solution. The Aspose.Cells Java API provides support for converting spreadsheets to JSON format. To export the workbook to JSON, pass [**SaveFormat.JSON**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/SaveFormat) as the second parameter of [**Workbook.save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#save-java.lang.String-int-) method. You may also use [**JsonSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/JsonSaveOptions) class to specify additional settings for exporting a worksheet to JSON.

The following code example demonstrates exporting an Excel workbook to JSON. Please see the code to convert [source file](sample.xlsx) to the JSON file generated by the code for reference.
