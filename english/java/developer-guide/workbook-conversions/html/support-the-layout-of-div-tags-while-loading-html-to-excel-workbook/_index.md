Normally, the layout of div tags is ignored while loading HTML into an excel workbook object. However, if you want the layout of div tags are not ignored, then please set the [HtmlLoadOptions.SupportDivTag](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/htmlloadoptions#SupportDivTag) property to **true**. The default value of this property is **false**.
