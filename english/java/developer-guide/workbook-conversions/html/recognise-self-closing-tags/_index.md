HTML can have a variety of tag formats for empty elements such as `<td></td>` or `<td/>`. Aspose.Cells now supports both of these formats, whereas earlier it supported only `<td></td>`-style tags. This feature can be tested by converting the attached sample HTML file to an Excel file. The sample HTML file and output files can be downloaded from the following links for testing.
