## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Previously, Aspose.Cells would create [**PdfBookmarkEntry**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for a normal sheet. But now Aspose.Cells can also create [**PdfBookmarkEntry**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for a chart sheet. Since a chart sheet does not have any cells except cell A1, it will create a [**PdfBookmarkEntry**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for cell A1 only.

## **Create PdfBookmarkEntry for Chart Sheet**

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](61767772.xlsx) that has four sheets: two normal sheets and two chart sheets. It creates four bookmark entries as follows:

- Bookmark-I
- Bookmark-II-Chart1
- Bookmark-III
- Bookmark-IV-Chart2

The following screenshot shows the [output PDF](61767771.pdf) generated by the sample code for reference.
