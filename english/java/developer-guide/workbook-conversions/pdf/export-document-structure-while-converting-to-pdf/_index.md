PDF logical structure facilities provide a mechanism for incorporating information regarding the document content structure into a PDF file. Aspose.Cells preserves information about the structure from a Microsoft Excel document, such as cell, row, table, worksheet, image, shape, header/footer, etc.

With the option [PdfSaveOptions.ExportDocumentStructure](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions/#setExportDocumentStructure-boolean-), you can save to a tagged PDF with the document structure exported.
