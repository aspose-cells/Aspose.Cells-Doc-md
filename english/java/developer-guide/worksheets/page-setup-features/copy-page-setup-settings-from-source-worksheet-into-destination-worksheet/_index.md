## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

When you add a new sheet to a workbook, it contains the default Page Setup settings. There may be times when you need to transfer the settings ([**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/PageSetup)) from one worksheet to another worksheet. This document explains how to copy Page Setup settings from one worksheet to another using Aspose.Cells APIs.
