## **Draw Timeline while Rendering Excel to PDF**

If you have an Excel file that has a timeline applied to it and you want to export the Excel file to PDF with the timeline settings, Aspose.Cells for Java now supports it by default. You simply export the Excel file with the timeline to PDF; the generated PDF will show the timeline applied.

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](input.xlsx) that contains an existing timeline. It then saves the workbook as an [output PDF file](out.pdf). The following screenshot compares the source Excel file and the generated PDF file.
