Sometime user needs to copy row heights of source range to destination range. Aspose.Cells provides [PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/pastetype#ROW-HEIGHTS) enum for this purpose. When you will set [PasteOptions.setPasteType()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/pasteoptions#PasteType) property with [PasteType.ROW_HEIGHTS](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/pastetype#ROW-HEIGHTS) enum then heights of all rows inside the source range will be copied to the destination range.
