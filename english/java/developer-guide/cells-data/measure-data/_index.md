Sometimes you need to calculate the width and height of a cell's value to fit the value inside the cell. Aspose.Cells provides [Cell.getWidthOfValue()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell#getWidthOfValue--) and [Cell.getHeightOfValue()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell#getHeightOfValue--) methods for this purpose. By using these methods you can calculate the width and height of the cell value and then set the column width and row height of that cell, respectively, which will adjust the cell to fit the value.

Alternatively, you can also [autofit rows and columns of your cells or a range of cells](/cells/java/autofit-rows-and-columns/) using Aspose.Cells APIs.
