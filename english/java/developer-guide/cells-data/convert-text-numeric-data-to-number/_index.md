## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Sometimes, you want to convert numeric data entered as text to numbers. You can enter numbers as text in Microsoft Excel by putting an apostrophe before a number, for example **'12345**. Excel then treats the number as a string. Aspose.Cells allows you to convert strings to numbers.


## Convert numbers stored as text to numbers in Excel
You can convert numbers stored as text to numbers by following a few simple steps.
1. Select any single cell or range of cells that has an error indicator in the upper-left corner.
1. Next to the selected cell or range of cells, click the error button that appears. On the menu, click Convert to Number.

1. If the alert button is not available, Select a column with this problem. If you don't want to convert the whole column, you can select one or more cells instead. Just be sure the cells you select are in the same column, otherwise this process won't work. The Text to Columns button is typically used for splitting a column, but it can also be used to convert a single column of text to numbers. On the Data tab, click Text to Columns.
