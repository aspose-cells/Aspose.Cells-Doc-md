## **This file format is not supported or you do not specify a correct format**

If the user has specified the file format when creating a workbook from a template file, this error is commonly because the specified file format is not the actual file format of the template file. If the user has not specified the file format, this is commonly because the file name extension does not represent the actual file format of the file and the file format cannot be detected automatically, such as CSV/TSV files, which have no special identifiers. Of course, file formats not supported by Cells will also report this error.
