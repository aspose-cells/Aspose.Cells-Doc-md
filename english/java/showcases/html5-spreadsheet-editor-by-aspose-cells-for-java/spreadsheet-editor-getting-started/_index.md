### **System Requirements**
**Software Requirements**

- [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java/)
- [JavaServer Faces 2.0](https://javaee.github.io/javaserverfaces-spec/)
- [PrimeFaces 5.1](https://www.primefaces.org/)

**Hardware Requirements**

- 2 GHz CPU
- 2 GB RAM
- 500 MB Disk

### **Download and Installation**
HTML5 Spreadsheet Editor is a Java EE application and can be deployed to any Java application server web profile with CDI support. It has been tested with [GlassFish](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/).
