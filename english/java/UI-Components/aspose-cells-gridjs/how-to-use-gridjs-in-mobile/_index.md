## Use GridJs on a Mobile Device

You can use GridJs smoothly on a mobile device.

GridJs client JavaScript can adapt to the mobile screen.

Run the [demo of GridJs](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells.Grid-for-Java/tree/master/Examples_GridJs "demo of GridJs")

The default port of the demo project is 8080.

Open the browser on your mobile device and enter the URL `http://yourip:8080/gridjsdemo/index`.

Then you can perform edit operations as on a PC device.
