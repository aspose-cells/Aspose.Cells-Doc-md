## **Building Aspose.Cells Java for Struts 1.3 from Source Codes**
After checking out source codes from any of the above repositories, apply the following mvn commands:

{{< highlight java >}}
$ mvn -U clean package
{{< /highlight >}}

This will build "Strutsbookapp.war" in the target folder.

To deploy the .war file, just copy it to the running Apache Tomcat server's webapp directory.
