## **Aspose.Cells - Autofit Rows and Columns**
### **Autofit Row**
The most straight-forward approach to auto-sizing the width and height of a row is to call the Worksheet class' autoFitRow method. The autoFitRow method takes a row index (of the row to be resized) as a parameter.

**Python Code**

{{< highlight python >}}

 def autofit_row(self):

\# Instantiating a Workbook object by excel file path

workbook = self.Workbook(self.dataDir + 'Book1.xls')

\# Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file

worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0)

\# Auto-fitting the 3rd row of the worksheet

worksheet.autoFitRow(2)

\# Auto-fitting the 3rd row of the worksheet based on the contents in a range of

\# cells (from 1st to 9th column) within the row

#worksheet.autoFitRow(2,0,8) # Uncomment this line if you to do AutoFit Row in a Range of Cells. Also, comment line 288.

\# Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format

workbook.save(self.dataDir + "Autofit Row.xls")

print "Autofit Row Successfully."

### **Autofit Column**
The easiest way to auto-size the width and height of a column is to call the Worksheet class' autoFitColumn method. The autoFitColumn method takes the column index (of the column about to be resized) as a parameter.

**Python Code**

{{< highlight python >}}

 def autofit_column(self):

\# Instantiating a Workbook object by excel file path

workbook = self.Workbook(self.dataDir + 'Book1.xls')

\# Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file

worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0)

\# Auto-fitting the 4th column of the worksheet

worksheet.autoFitColumn(3)

\# Auto-fitting the 4th column of the worksheet based on the contents in a range of

\# cells (from 1st to 9th row) within the column

#worksheet.autoFitColumn(3,0,8) #Uncomment this line if you to do AutoFit Column in a Range of Cells. Also, comment line 310.

\# Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format

workbook.save(self.dataDir + "Autofit Column.xls")

print "Autofit Column Successfully."
