## **Introduction**
### **Eclipse IDE**
Eclipse IDE is a famous Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE is definitely the most well‑known product of the Eclipse Open Source project. Today it is the leading development environment for Java with a market share of approximately 60%.

The Eclipse IDE can be extended with additional software components. Eclipse calls these software components Plug‑ins. Several Open Source projects and companies have extended the Eclipse IDE or created standalone applications (Eclipse RCP) on top of the Eclipse framework.
