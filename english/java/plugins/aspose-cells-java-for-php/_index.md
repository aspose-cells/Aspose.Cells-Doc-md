## **Introduction to Aspose.Cells Java for PHP**
### **PHP/Java Bridge**
The PHP/Java Bridge is an implementation of a streaming, XML‑based [network protocol](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/PROTOCOL.TXT), which can be used to connect a native script engine, for example PHP, Scheme or Python, with a Java virtual machine. It is up to 50 times faster than local RPC via SOAP, requires less resources on the web‑server side. It is faster and more reliable than direct communication via the Java Native Interface, and it requires no additional components to invoke Java procedures from PHP or PHP procedures from Java.

### **Aspose.Cells for Java**
Aspose.Cells for Java is an award‑winning Excel Spreadsheet component that allows Java developers to embed the ability to read, write and manipulate Excel® spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, XLTX, SpreadsheetML, CSV, ODS), HTML, MHTML, PDF and image file formats into their own Java applications without needing to rely on Microsoft Excel®.

Aspose.Cells for Java is a mature, scalable and feature‑rich component that offers many functions that are way beyond the simple data‑exporting capabilities of other vendors. **With Aspose.Cells for Java, developers can** export data, format spreadsheets to the most granular level, import images, create charts, apply and calculate complex formulas, stream Excel® data, save in various formats and much more – all this without the need **for** Microsoft Excel® or Microsoft Office Automation.

### **Aspose.Cells Java for PHP**
Project Aspose.Cells for PHP shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells Java APIs in PHP. This project is **aimed at providing** useful examples for PHP developers who want to **utilise** Aspose.Cells for Java in their PHP projects using the [PHP/Java Bridge](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/).

## **System Requirements and Supported Platforms**
### **System Requirements**
**The following are the system requirements to use Aspose.Cells Java for PHP:**

- Tomcat Server 8.0 or above installed.
- PHP/JavaBridge is configured.
- FastCGI is installed.
- Aspose.Cells component is downloaded.

### **Supported Platforms**
**The following are the supported platforms:**

- PHP 5.3 or above
- Java 1.8 or above

## **Downloads and Configuration**
### **Download Required Libraries**
Download the required libraries mentioned below. These are required for executing Aspose.Cells Java for PHP examples.

- **Aspose:** [Aspose.Cells for Java Component](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/java)
- [PHP/Java Bridge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_7.2.1/php-java-bridge_7.2.1_documentation.zip/download)

### **Download Examples from Social Coding Sites**
The following releases of running examples are available to download on the social coding sites listed below:

-----

#### **GitHub**
- **Aspose.Cells Java for PHP Examples**  
  - [Aspose.Cells Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Cells_Java_for_PHP)

### **How to configure the source code on Linux Platform**
Please follow these simple steps in order to open and extend the source code while using:

#### **1. Install Tomcat Server**
To install Tomcat Server, issue the following command on the Linux console. This will successfully install Tomcat Server.

```actionscrip t3
sudo apt-get install tomcat8
```

#### **2. Download and Configure PHP/JavaBridge**
To download the PHP/JavaBridge binaries, issue the following command on the Linux console.

```actionscrip t3
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_7.2.1/php-java-bridge_7.2.1_documentation.zip/download
```

Unzip the PHP/JavaBridge binaries by issuing the following command on the Linux console.

```actionscrip t3
unzip -d php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip
```

This will extract **JavaBridge.war** file. Copy it to the Tomcat 8 **webapps** folder by issuing the following command on the Linux console.

```actionscrip t3
sudo cp JavaBridge.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/JavaBridge.war
```

Tomcat 8 will automatically create a new folder **JavaBridge** in **webapps**. Once the folder is created, make sure Tomcat 8 is running and then check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** in a browser; it should open the default page of JavaBridge.

If any error message appears, install **FastCGI** by issuing the following command on the Linux console.

```actionscrip t3
sudo apt-get install php55-cgi
```

After installing php5.5 CGI, restart the Tomcat 8 server and check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** again in the browser.

If a **JAVA_HOME** error is displayed, open `/etc/default/tomcat8` and uncomment the line that sets `JAVA_HOME`. Check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** again; it should show the PHP/JavaBridge examples page.

#### **3. Configure Aspose.Cells Java for PHP Examples**
Clone the PHP examples by issuing the following commands inside the `webapps/JavaBridge` folder.

```actionscrip t3
git init
git clone https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Cells_Java_for_PHP
```

### **How to configure the source code on Windows Platform**
Please follow the simple steps below to configure PHP/Java Bridge on Windows Platform.

1. Install PHP 5 and configure it as you normally do.  
2. Install JRE 6 (Java Runtime Environment) if you don’t already have it. You can check this in *C:\Program Files…*. You can download it here. I am using JRE 6 **as it is** compatible with PHP Java Bridge (PJB).  
3. Install Apache Tomcat 8.0. You can download it here.  
4. **Download** [JavaBridge.war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/JavaBridgeTemplate621.war/download) and copy this file to the Tomcat *webapps* directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps`).  
5. Restart the Tomcat service.  
6. Go to **localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php** to check if PHP works. You can find other examples there.  
7. Copy your [Aspose.Cells Java](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/java) JAR file to `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\WEB-INF\lib`.  
8. Clone the **Aspose.Cells Java for PHP** examples inside `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\`.  
9. Copy the folder `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\java` to your Aspose.Cells Java for PHP examples folder.  
10. Restart the Apache Tomcat service and start using the examples.
