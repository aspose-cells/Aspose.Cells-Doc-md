## **Download from GitHub**
All examples of Aspose.Cells for Java are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-java). You can either clone the repository using your favorite GitHub client or download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-java/archive/master.zip).

Extract the contents of the ZIP file to any folder on your computer. All the examples are located in the **Examples** folder.

The **Resources** folder contains input documents or files used in the examples.

You can run/execute these examples with any IDE **of your** choice; however, for demonstration purposes, we are using **Eclipse**. Use the **File -> Import** option to import the example of your choice and specify the path.

Add the required jar files (Libraries) **to** the project.

Each example is provided as a separate runnable class. Right-click the file and choose Run File.

Examples are in the form of **an** Eclipse Project. Please open the Examples in Eclipse using the **File > Open Projects from File System...** menu command and follow the steps. **You should now be able to run the examples successfully.**

or inside the package

AsposeCellsExamples.DrawingObjects,

and run it.
