You can easily download Aspose.Cells for evaluation from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/). The evaluation download is the same as the download for the full version: the evaluation becomes licensed when you apply a license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Cells (that is, Aspose.Cells without a license applied) provides most of the product functionality. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with evaluation watermark on open / save any spreadsheet document.
