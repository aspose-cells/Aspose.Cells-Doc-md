## **How to Get Evaluation Version of Aspose.Cells**

You can download an evaluation version of **Aspose.Cells** for Java from its download page on the Maven repository. The evaluation version provides exactly the same capabilities as the licensed version of the product. Furthermore, the evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

Once you are happy with your evaluation of **Aspose.Cells**, you can [purchase a license](https://purchase.aspose.com) at the Aspose website. Familiarize yourself with the different subscription types offered. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the Aspose sales team.

Every Aspose license carries a one‑year subscription for free upgrades to any new versions or fixes that come out during this time. Technical support is free, unlimited, and provided to both licensed and evaluation users.

## **How to Test Aspose.Cells Without Evaluation Version Limitations**

If you want to test **Aspose.Cells** without evaluation version limitations, request a 30‑day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) for more information.

## **Evaluation Version Limitations**

The evaluation version of **Aspose.Cells** (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it is limited to opening 100 files in a single program and includes an extra worksheet with an evaluation watermark.

The limitations are shown below:

### **1st Limitation: Number of Opened Files**

When running your program, you can only open 100 Excel files. If your application exceeds this number, an exception will be thrown.

### **2nd Limitation: Worksheet with Evaluation Watermark**
This worksheet will always appear as the active worksheet. Only in the licensed version can you set the active worksheet to another worksheet.

### **3rd Limitation: Plain Text with Evaluation Information**
In the output plain‑text file generated by Aspose.Cells, an evaluation notice will be added at the end of the document. When saving a file to plain text (such as CSV or TSV formats), only the content of the first worksheet is output.
