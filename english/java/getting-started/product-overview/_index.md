## **Welcome to the Aspose.Cells documentation**
**Aspose.Cells** is the most flexible component that enables Java applications to create and manage Excel spreadsheets without requiring **Microsoft Excel** to be installed on the system. Unlike similar products from other vendors, Aspose.Cells not only supports spreadsheet generation and other basic file‑formatting features, but also supports a number of advanced features. These advanced features make it much more convenient for developers to manipulate spreadsheet contents, cell formatting, and file protection. Aspose.Cells also allows importing data into spreadsheets from different data sources, adding common and complex mathematical, DateTime, financial, and text formulas/functions, and supports manipulation of charts, pictures, comments, drawing objects, and controls, etc.

Aspose.Cells for Java also provides a complete grid solution for web clients; it has a GUI‑based control as follows:

- Aspose.Cells.GridWeb, which supports web applications

Using Aspose.Cells.GridWeb for Java grid control, developers can import from and export to Excel® spreadsheets easily. Any user who is familiar with Microsoft Excel can control the look and feel of the grid. Aspose.Cells offers a rich set of features such as controlling the design and layout of the grid, managing multiple worksheets, managing cells, rows, and columns of a worksheet, creating and calculating formulas, etc.
