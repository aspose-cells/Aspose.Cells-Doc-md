## **Aspose.Cells - Display and Hide Tabs of Workbook**
Aspose.Cells provides a class, Workbook, that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The Workbook class provides a wide range of properties and methods for managing an Excel file. To control the visibility of tabs in an Excel file, developers can use the Workbook class' setShowTabs method.

**Java**

{{< highlight java >}}

 //Instantiating a Workbook object by excel file path

Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "book1.xls");

//Hiding the tabs of the Excel file

workbook.getSettings().setShowTabs(false);

//Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format

workbook.save(dataDir + "AsposeHideTabs.xls");

// ===============================================================

//Displaying the tabs of the Excel file

workbook.getSettings().setShowTabs(true);

//Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format

workbook.save(dataDir + "AsposeDisplayTabs.xls");
