Please note that running the **Repair** option does not re-activate Aspose.Cells for SharePoint on site collections. Instead, the feature must be activated manually after re-deployment with the **Repair** option.

Uninstalling using the **Remove** option and then re-installing may be more convenient as it allows you to select target web applications and site collections during installation.
