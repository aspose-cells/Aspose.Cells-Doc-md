## **Check for Populated Cells**

Worksheets can have one or more cells populated with values where a value can be simple (text, numeric, date/time) or a formula or a formula-based value. In such a case, it is easy to detect if a given worksheet is empty or not. All we have to check is the [**Cells.maxDataRow**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/cells/#maxDataRow--) or [**Cells.maxDataColumn**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/cells/#maxDataColumn--) properties. If the aforementioned properties return zero or positive values that means, one or more cells have been populated; however, if any of these properties return -1, that indicates that none of the cells have been populated in the given worksheet.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

The rows & columns collections have zero-based indices; therefore, a cell at row 0 & column 0 means the first cell in the worksheet, which is A1.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Check for Empty Initialized Cells**

All cells that have values are automatically initialized; however, there is a possibility that a worksheet has cells with only formatting applied. In such a scenario, the [**Cells.maxDataRow**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/cells/#maxDataRow--) or [**Cells.maxDataColumn**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/cells/#maxDataColumn--) properties will return -1 indicating the absence of any populated values, but initialized cells due to cell formatting cannot be detected using this approach. In order to check if a worksheet has empty initialized cells, it is advised to use the `Enumerator.MoveNext` method on the enumerator acquired from [**Cells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/cells) collection. If the `Enumerator.MoveNext` method returns **true**, that means there are one or more initialized cells in the given worksheet.

## **Check for Shapes**

It is possible that a given worksheet does not have any populated cells; however, it could contain shapes & objects such as controls, charts, images, and so on. If we need to check if a worksheet contains any shape, we can do it by inspecting the [**ShapeCollection.count**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/javascript-cpp/shapecollection/#count--) property. Any positive value indicates the presence of shape(s) in the worksheet.

## **Programming Sample**
