## **Export print area range to HTML**
Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports exporting only the print area i.e. selected range of cells instead of the entire she'st to HTML. For this, the API provides the [HtmlSaveOptions.ExportPrintAreaOnly](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#ExportPrintAreaOnly) property. Setting this property to **True** will only export the print area.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [HtmlSaveOptions.ExportPrintAreaOnly](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#ExportPrintAreaOnly) property to export only the print area to HTML.
