## **Get Hyperlinks in Range**
To get hyperlinks in range, use the [getHyperlinks()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/range#Hyperlinks) property of the [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/Range) class. The [getHyperlinks()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/range#Hyperlinks) property gets all the hyperlinks in the selected range.

The following code snippet shows how to get all hyperlinks in the selected range.
