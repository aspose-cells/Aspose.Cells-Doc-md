## **Set the Comment of Table or List Object inside the Worksheet**
Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports adding the comment of List Object. For this, the API provides the [ListObject.Comment](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/listobject#Comment) property. The comment added by the [ListObject.Comment](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/listobject#Comment) property will be visible inside the *xl/tables/tableName.xml* file.

The following screenshot shows the comment created by the sample code in the red rectangle.
