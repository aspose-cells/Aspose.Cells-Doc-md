## **Convert Excel to SVG**
SVG(**Scalable Vector Graphics)** is a specification based on XML standards for two-dimensional vector graphics. It is an open standard that has been under development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.

Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports converting Excel files to SVG images. For this, the API provides the [SheetRender](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/SheetRender), [ImageOrPrintOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/ImageOrPrintOptions), and [WorkbookRender](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/WorkbookRender) classes.

The following code snippet demonstrates converting an Excel worksheet to an SVG image.
