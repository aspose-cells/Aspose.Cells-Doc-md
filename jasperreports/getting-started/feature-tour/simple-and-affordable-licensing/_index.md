Every Aspose license comes with 1-year worth of [free upgrades](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/policies/Subscriptions.aspx) to any new version of the product that comes out and unlimited free technical support.

Aspose.Cells for JasperReports evaluation and paid versions are the same download. Simply [download Aspose.Cells for JasperReports](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.cells-for-jasperreports/default.aspx) and [install it](/cells/jasperreports/installation-html/). By default, the exporter works in evaluation mode. Evaluation mode injects watermarks into exported reports. To remove the watermark, [purchase a license](http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.purchase/220/showforum.aspx) and follow the instructions on [how to apply the license](/cells/jasperreports/licensing-html/). 

Make sure to take advantage of the Aspose.Cells for JasperReports evaluation as it does not have a time limit and comes with free technical support.
