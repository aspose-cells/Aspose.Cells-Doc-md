description: 学习如何用Aspose.Cells通过Golang与C++处理HTML中的自闭合标签
---

HTML can have a variety of tag formats for empty tags like `<td></td>` or `<td/>`. Aspose.Cells supports both these formats now, whereas earlier it was supporting only `<td></td>` like tags. This feature can be tested by converting the attached sample HTML file to an Excel file. The sample HTML file and output Excel file can be downloaded from the following links for testing.
