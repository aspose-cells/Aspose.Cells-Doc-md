Aspose.Cells provides a method, Aspose.Cells.Worksheet.Copy() used to copy data and formatting from a source worksheet to another worksheet within or between workbooks. The method takes the source worksheet object as a parameter.

The following example shows how to copy a worksheet from one workbook to another workbook.

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 string FilePath = @"..\..\..\Sample Files\";

string FileName = FilePath + "Copy Sheet between Workbook.xlsx";

//Create a new Workbook.

Workbook excelWorkbook0 = new Workbook();

//Get the first worksheet in the book.

Worksheet ws0 = excelWorkbook0.Worksheets[0];

//Put some data into header rows (A1:A4)

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)

{

    ws0.Cells[i, 0].PutValue(string.Format("Header Row {0}", i));

}

//Put some detail data (A5:A999)

for (int i = 5; i < 1000; i++)

{

    ws0.Cells[i, 0].PutValue(string.Format("Detail Row {0}", i));

}

//Define a pagesetup object based on the first worksheet.

PageSetup pagesetup = ws0.PageSetup;

//The first five rows are repeated in each page...

//It can be seen in print preview.

pagesetup.PrintTitleRows = "$1:$5";

//Create another Workbook.

Workbook excelWorkbook1 = new Workbook();

//Get the first worksheet in the book.

Worksheet ws1 = excelWorkbook1.Worksheets[0];

//Name the worksheet.

ws1.Name = "MySheet";

//Copy data from the first worksheet of the first workbook into the

//first worksheet of the second workbook.

ws1.Copy(ws0);

//Save the excel file.

excelWorkbook1.Save(FileName);
