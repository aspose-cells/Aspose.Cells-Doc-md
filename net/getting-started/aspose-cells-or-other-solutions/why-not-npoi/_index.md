Sometimes we get the following question: why should we use Aspose products rather than the NPOI? This question is easy to answer: features and functionality.

NPOI (NET version of POI Java project) is an open source project that can help you read or write files in Microsoft Office formats. As part of the current comparison, consider the following NPOI components –  HSSF and XSSF:

**HSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel '97(-2007) file format.

**XSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format.

HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets. They provide:

- low level structures for those with special needs
- an eventmodel api for efficient read-only access
- a full usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying XLS files

Both HSSF and XSSF provides Basis Text Extraction, Specific Text Extraction, Access of Header & Footers, and Changing Text features. While HSSF and XSSF provide similar functionality, they currently do not have a common interface. It has a fairly stable core API providing read or write access to the main parts of .xlsx files, but it is not complete.

Aspose.Cells is a very useful document processing library that provides great support for all Microsoft Excel and other document formats. With Aspose.Cells you can read, generate, modify, convert, render, and print documents without using Microsoft Excel.

In this article, we will look at when it makes sense for you to prefer Aspose.Cells.

## Why not NPOI

It is worth noting that some tasks can be achieved with Aspose.Cells, but cannot be accomplished with NPOI. For example, if you need to convert Excel files to Pdf , JSON and images,then you cannot use only NPOI, you also need Microsoft Excel 365 or other tools.

You can compare NPOI with Aspose.Cells To do this, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the Aspose.Cells for NPOI project (HSSF and XSSF) – it shows how different tasks can be done using the Aspose.Cells for .NET API versus NPOI. The project also covers features for working with text documents that are only available in Aspose.Cells, but not in NPOI.

This project is also useful for developers looking to migrate from NPOI to Aspose.Cells.

This plugin uses the evaluation version of Aspose.Cells. When you are happy with your evaluation, you can purchase a license from the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). To remove the evaluation message and feature limitations, you must apply a product license. After purchasing the product, you will receive a license file. Please follow the instructions in the ["Licensing and Subscription"](/cells/net/licensing/) article to do this.

In the following sections and articles, we will take a closer look at some of the features and abilities provided by Aspose.Cells.

### Stability

Aspose components are thoroughly tested. Since Aspose components are packaged into a single DLL, there will never be a need to install any additional parts or pieces for them to function. This allows not only to provide a stable work with Aspose.Words, but also reduce the risk of unforeseen situations to virtually zero.

### Scalability and Speed

Aspose components are highly scalable and lightning fast. They are a true .NET solution and perform flawlessly on either a single server powering a single application or a load balanced web farm powering an enterprise application.

### Features

Aspose components provide everything you need to manage Office files, plus much, much more. They are designed with the philosophy of allowing developers to accomplish the greatest results with the least amount of work.

Aspose components provide many powerful time-saving functions. For example, [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/) offers a feature that allows developers to import JSON to Excel files. It is worth noting that every component in the Aspose family offers its own set of unique and powerful features.
