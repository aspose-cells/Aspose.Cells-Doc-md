Project Aspose.Cells for NPOI (HSSF and XSSF) shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells .NET APIs in comparison with NPOI. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Cells APIs but not in NPOI for dealing with Microsoft Excel files or OpenOffice Spreadsheets.

This project is helpful for developers who want to compare NPOI with Aspose.Cells OR migrate from NPOI to Aspose.Cells.

## **Getting Started**

### **Introduction**

#### **Why Aspose for NPOI (HSSF and XSSF)?**

The developers looking for file format APIs may need to walk through the features provided by the APIs available on the market. Mostly following factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required to use the API
- Comparison between libraries to determine which is better

If you are a .NET developer looking to choose a file format API to process files, you may want to compare NPOI with Aspose.

Project Aspose.Cells for NPOI (HSSF and XSSF) shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells .NET APIs in comparison with NPOI. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Cells APIs but not in NPOI for dealing with word processing documents.

This project is helpful for developers who want to compare NPOI with Aspose.Cells OR migrate from NPOI to Aspose.Cells.

#### **What's NPOI**

NPOI is the .NET version of POI Java project at <http://poi.apache.org/>. POI is an open source project which can help you read/write XLS, DOC, PPT files.
