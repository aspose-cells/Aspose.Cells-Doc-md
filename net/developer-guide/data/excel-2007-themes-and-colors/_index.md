## **Excel 2007 Themes and Colors**

Themes provide a unified look with named styles, graphical effects and other objects used in a workbook. For example, the Accent1 style, for example, looks different in the Office and the Apex themes. Often, you apply a document theme and then amend it to how you want it.

Aspose.Cells provides features for customizing themes and colors.

### **Get and Set Theme Colors**

Below are a few methods and properties that implement theme colors.

- [**Style.ForegroundThemeColor**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/style/properties/foregroundthemecolor): Used to set the foreground color.
