## **Introduction**

In Excel, you can select multiple cells with a mouse box selection, the set of selected cells is called "Range".

For example, you can click the left mouse button in Cell "A1" of the Excel and then drag to cell "C4". The rectangular area you selected can also be easily created as an object by using Aspose.Cells.

Here is how to create range, put value, set style, and do more operations to the "Range" object.

## **Managing Ranges Using Aspose.Cells**

Aspose.Cells provides a class, [**Workbook**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The [**Workbook**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) class contains a [**Worksheets**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook/properties/worksheets) collection that allows access to each worksheet in an Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the [**Worksheet**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class. The [**Worksheet**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class provides a [**Cells**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cells) collection.

### **Create Range**

When you want to create a rectangular area that extends over A1:C4, you can use the following code:

### **Put value into the Cells of the Range**

Say you have a range of cells that extends over A1:C4. The matrix makes 4 * 3 = 12 cells. The individual range cells are arranged sequentially: Range[0,0], Range[0,1], Range[0,2], Range[1,0], Range[1,1], Range[1,2], Range[2,0], Range[2,1], Range[2,2], Range[3,0], Range[3,1], Range[3,2].

The following example shows how to input some values into the cells of the Range.

### **Set style of the Cells of the Range**

The following example shows how to set style of the cells of the Range.

### **Auto Fill Ranges**

The following example shows how to do AutoFill operation to the Range, and here is the sample file which can be downloaded for testing this feature:
