## **Converting Excel Workbook to HTML**
The Aspose.Cells API provides support for exporting spreadsheets to HTML and  format. For this purpose, Aspose.Cells uses the **[HtmlSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions)** class to provide the flexibility to control several aspects of the output HTML.

The code example below shows how to save a workbook as an HTML file using C#:

MHTML combines normal HTML with external resources (that is, content that is usually linked in, like images, animations, audio, and so on) into one file. They are used for emails with the .mht file extension.Aspose.Cells supports reading and writing MHTML files.

The code example below shows how to save a workbook as an MHTML file using C#:
