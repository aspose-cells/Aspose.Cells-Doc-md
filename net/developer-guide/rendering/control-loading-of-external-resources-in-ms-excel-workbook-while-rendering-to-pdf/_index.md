## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Your Excel file may contain external resources e.g. linked images or objects. When you convert your Excel file to PDF, Aspose.Cells retrieves these external resources and renders them to PDF. But sometimes, you do not want to load these external resources and more than that, you want to manipulate them. You can do this using [WorkbookSettings.StreamProvider](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/streamprovider) which implements the [IStreamProvider](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/istreamprovider) interface.
## **Control loading of External Resources in MS Excel Workbook while rendering to PDF**
The following sample code explains how to make use of [WorkbookSettings.StreamProvider](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/streamprovider) to control the loading of external resources and manipulate them. Please check the [sample Excel file](50528322.xlsx) used inside the code and the [output PDF](50528325.pdf) generated by the code. The [screenshot](50528326.png) shows how the [old external image](50528324.png) in the sample Excel file was replaced with a [new image](50528323.png) in the output PDF.
