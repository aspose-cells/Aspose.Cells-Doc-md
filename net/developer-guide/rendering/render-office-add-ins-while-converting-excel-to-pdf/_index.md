## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Earlier, Aspose.Cells could not render Office Add-Ins when Excel file is saved to Pdf format. Now Aspose.Cells renders it fine. You do not need to use any special method or property to render Office Add-Ins in output Pdf. Just save your Excel file to Pdf format and it will render Office Add-Ins.
## **Render Office Add-Ins while converting Excel to Pdf**
The following sample code saves the [sample Excel file](60489769.xlsx) which contains the Office Add-Ins. Please see the [output Pdf generated with the previous version i.e. 17.11](60489770.pdf) and the [output Pdf generated with newer version i.e. 17.12 and onward](60489771.pdf). The previous version output Pdf is blank but the newer version output Pdf shows the Office Add-In.
