## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
You can format the slicer in Microsoft Excel by setting its number of columns or by setting its style etc. Aspose.Cells also allows you to do this using the [Slicer.NumberOfColumns](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/properties/numberofcolumns) and [Slicer.StyleType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.slicers/slicer/properties/styletype) properties.
## **Formatting Slicer**
Please see the following code, it loads the [sample Excel file](attachments/66948320/67338473.xlsx) that contains a slicer. It accesses the slicer and sets its number of columns and style type and saves it as [output Excel file](attachments/66948320/67338474.xlsx). The screenshot shows how the slicer looks after the execution of the sample code.
