## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

There might be situations where you may want to change the properties of the Slicer such as placement or row height. Aspose.Cells provides you with the option to update these properties.

## **Change Slicer Properties**

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](sampleCreateSlicerToExcelTable.xlsx) that contains a table. It then creates the slicer based on the first column and changes its properties like row height, width, is printable, title, etc. It saves the workbook as [outputChangeSlicerProperties.xlsx](outputChangeSlicerProperties.xlsx).
