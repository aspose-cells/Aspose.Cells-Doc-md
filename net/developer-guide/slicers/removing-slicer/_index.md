## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
If you want to remove slicer in Microsoft Excel, just select it and press the *Delete* button. Similarly, if you want to remove it using Aspose.Cells API programmatically, please use the [Worksheet.Slicers.Remove()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.slicers/slicercollection/methods/remove) method. It will remove the slicer from the worksheet. 
## **Removing Slicer**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](attachments/66948347/67338478.xlsx) that contains an existing slicer. It accesses the slicers and then removes it. Finally, it saves the workbook as [output Excel file](attachments/66948347/67338477.xlsx). The following screenshot shows the slicer that will be removed after the execution of the sample code.
