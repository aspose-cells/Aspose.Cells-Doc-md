## **Threaded Comments**

MS Excel 365 provides a feature to add threaded comments. These comments work as conversations and can be used for discussions. The comments now come with a Reply box that allows for threaded conversations. The old comments are called Notes in Excel 365. The screenshot below shows how threaded comments are displayed when opened in Excel.
