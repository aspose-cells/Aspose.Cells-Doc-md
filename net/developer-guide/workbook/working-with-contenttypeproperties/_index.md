Aspose.Cells provides [**Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypepropertycollection/methods/add/index) method to add custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. You may also make the property optional by setting the [**ContentTypeProperty.IsNillable**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypeproperty/properties/isnillable) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
