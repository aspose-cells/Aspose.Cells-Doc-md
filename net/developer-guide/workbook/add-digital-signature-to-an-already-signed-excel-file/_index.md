## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Workbook.AddDigitalSignature(DigitalSignatureCollection digitalSignatureCollection)](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbook/methods/adddigitalsignature) method that you can use to add digital signature to an already signed Excel file.

Please note while adding a digital signature to an already signed Excel document, if the original document is Aspose.Cells generated document, it works well. But if the original document is generated by other engines (e.g. Microsoft Excel etc.), Aspose.Cells cannot keep the file same after loading and re-saving it, this will make the original signature to be invalid.
