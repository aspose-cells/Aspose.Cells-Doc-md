Sometimes you need to insert some necessary shapes into the worksheet.You may need to insert the same shape in different positions of the worksheet.Or you need to batch insert shapes in the worksheet.

Do not worry! [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) supports all these operations.

{{% /alert %}}

The shapes in excel are mainly divided into the following types:
- **Pictures**
- **OleObjects**
- **Lines**
- **Rectangles**
- **Basic Shapes**
- **Block Arrows**
- **Equation Shapes**
- **FlowCharts**
- **Stars and Banners**
- **Callouts**

This guide document will select one or two shapes from each type to make samples.Through these examples, you will learn how to use [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) to insert the specified shape into the worksheet.

## **Adding Pictures in Excel Worksheet in C#**

Adding pictures to a spreadsheet is very easy. It only takes a few lines of code:
Simply call the [**Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/methods/add/index) method of the [**Pictures**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection) collection (encapsulated in the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet) object). The [**Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/methods/add/index) method takes the following parameters:

- **Upper left row index**, the index of the upper left row.
- **Upper left column index**, the index of the upper left column.
- **Image file name**, the name of the image file, complete with path.

## **Inserting OLE Objects into Excel Worksheet in C#**

Aspose.Cells supports adding, extracting and manipulating OLE objects in worksheets. For this reason, Aspose.Cells has the [**OleObjectCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobjectcollection) class, used to add a new OLE Object to the collection list. Another class, [**OleObject**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobject), represents an OLE Object. It has some important members:

- The [**ImageData**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobject/properties/imagedata) property specifies the image (icon) data of byte array type. The image will be displayed to show the OLE Object in the worksheet.
- The [**ObjectData**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobject/properties/objectdata) property specifies the object data in the form of a byte array. This data will be shown in its related program when you double-click on the OLE Object icon.

The following example shows how to add an OLE Object(s) into a worksheet.
