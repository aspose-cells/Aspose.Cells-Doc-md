Aspose.Cells allows you to assign a Macro Code to a Form Control like a Button. Please use the [Shape.MarcoName](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/macroname) property to assign a new Macro Code to a Form Control inside the workbook.

The following sample code creates a new workbook, assign a Macro Code to a Form Buttom and saves the output in the XLSM format. Once, you will open the output XLSM file in Microsoft Excel you will see the following macro code.

{{< highlight java >}}

 Sub ShowMessage()

    MsgBox "Welcome to Aspose!"

End Sub

{{< /highlight >}}

Here is the sample code to generate the output XLSMÂ file with Macro Code.
