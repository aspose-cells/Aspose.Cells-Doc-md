## **Move Worksheets within a Workbook**
Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop provides a method, Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.WorksheetCollection.MoveTo(), that is used to move a worksheet to the specified index. It takes the indexes (zero-based) of the source worksheet and destination worksheet as parameters. It is basically used to move a worksheet to another location in the same spreadsheet.

The following example shows how to move a worksheet to another location within the workbook.
