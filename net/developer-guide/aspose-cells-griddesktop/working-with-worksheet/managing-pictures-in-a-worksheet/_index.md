## **Adding Pictures**
To add a hyperlink to a cell using Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop, please follow the steps below:

- Add Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control to your **Form**
- Access any desired **Worksheet**
- Add **Picture** to the worksheet by specifying the file path of picture and cell name where the picture will be inserted

**Pictures** collection in the **Worksheet** object provides an overloaded **Add** method. Developers can use any overloaded version of **Add** method according to their specific needs.
