## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Smart Art Shapes are special shapes in Microsoft Excel that allow you to create complex diagrams automatically. You can find if the shape is a smart art shape or normal shape using [Shape.IsSmartArt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/issmartart) property.
## **Determine if Shape is Smart Art Shape**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](attachments/54690177/55541792.xlsx) containing a smart art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then prints the value of [Shape.IsSmartArt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/issmartart) property of the first shape. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
