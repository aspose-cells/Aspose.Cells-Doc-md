## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [**Shape.TextBody.TextAlignment**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/fontsettingcollection/properties/textalignment) property. This property returns the object of [**Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Texts.ShapeTextAlignment**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class which has different properties e.g. [**TopMarginPt**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/topmarginpt), [**LeftMarginPt**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/leftmarginpt), [**BottomMarginPt**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/bottommarginpt), [**RightMarginPt**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/rightmarginpt), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom and right margins.

## **Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet**

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](61767851.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](61767852.xlsx) generated by the code and screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.
