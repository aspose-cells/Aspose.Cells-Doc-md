## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [Shape.TextBody.TextAlignmen](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/fontsettingcollection/properties/textalignment)t property. This property returns the object of [Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Texts.ShapeTextAlignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class which has different properties e.g. [TopMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/topmarginpt), [LeftMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/leftmarginpt), [BottomMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/bottommarginpt), [RightMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/rightmarginpt), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom and right margins.
