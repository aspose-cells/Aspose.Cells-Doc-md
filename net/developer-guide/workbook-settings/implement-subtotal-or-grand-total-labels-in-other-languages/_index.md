## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Sometimes, you want to show subtotal and grand total labels in non-English languages like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi etc. Aspose.Cells allows you to do this using the [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class and [**Workbook.GlobalizationSettings**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/globalizationsettings) property. Please see this article on how to make use of [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class

Please check the [output Excel file](5115152.xlsx) generated by this code for your reference. We first create a class of [**GlobalizationSettings**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) and then use it in our code.
