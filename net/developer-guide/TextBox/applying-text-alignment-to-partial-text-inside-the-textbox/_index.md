TextBoxes can improve the expressiveness of our documents and diagrams, and applying different alignments to different parts of a TextBox can help highlight points of interest to readers.

If you don't have a lot of TextBox objects to tweak, you're in luck. If there are so many TextBoxes to adjust, I think you will be in trouble. Don't worry now, [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) provides such an API interface to help you do just that.
