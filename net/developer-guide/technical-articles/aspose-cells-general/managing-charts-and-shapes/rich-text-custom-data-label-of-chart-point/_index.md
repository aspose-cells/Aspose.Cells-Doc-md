You can use Aspose.Cells to create rich text custom data label of the chart point. Aspose.Cells provides the [**DataLabels.Characters()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/charttextframe/methods/characters) method to return the [**FontSetting**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) object which can be used to set the font properties of the text like its color, boldness, etc.
