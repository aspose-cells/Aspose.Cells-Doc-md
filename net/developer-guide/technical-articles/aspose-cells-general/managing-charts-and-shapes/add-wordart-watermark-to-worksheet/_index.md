Use WordArt to add special text effects to spreadsheets. For example, stretch a title across the top of the file, decorate text, and make text fit a preset shape, or apply text to an Excel sheet as a background watermark. The WordArt becomes an object that you can move or position in spreadsheets to add decoration.
