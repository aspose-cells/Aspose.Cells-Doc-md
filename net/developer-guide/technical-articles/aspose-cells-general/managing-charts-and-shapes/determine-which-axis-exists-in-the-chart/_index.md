Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the Chart. For example, he wants to know if a Secondary Value Axis exists inside the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have an axis.

Aspose.Cells provides [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/methods/hasaxis) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.
