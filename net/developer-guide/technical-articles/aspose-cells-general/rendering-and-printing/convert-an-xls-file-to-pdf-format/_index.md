PDF (Portable Document Format) represents documents independently of the software, hardware, and operating system used to create those documents. A PDF file can be documents with any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device-independent and resolution-independent manner. PDF files are often compressed, so they take up less space than the original file.

There are numerous conversion tools that can perform this task. But you have to make sure that the layout of the original Excel document is retained in the output PDF file.

### **The Template Excel File**

The template file has three worksheets, including charts and image as Media. The first worksheet has charts and last worksheet has an image as shown below in the screenshots.

If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call Workbook.CalculateFormula() just before rendering the spreadsheet to PDF. Doing so ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
