PDF (Portable Document Format) represents documents independently of the software, hardware, and operating system used to create those documents. A PDF file can be documents with any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device-independent and resolution-independent manner. PDF files are often compressed, so they take up less space than the original file.

At times, you need to convert a Microsoft Excel file to PDF. For this, you require a fast, secure, accurate and reliable solution that lets you distribute PDF documents around the world. There are numerous conversion tools that can perform this task. But you have to make sure that the layout of the original Excel document is retained in the output PDF file.

If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call Workbook.CalculateFormula() just before rendering the spreadsheet to PDF. Doing so ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
