Sometimes users want to export excel data into a data table without any formatting. For example, if some cell has a value 0.012345 and it is formatted as to display two decimal places, then when the user will export excel data to a data table, it will be exported as 0.01 and not as 0.012345. To deal with this problem, Aspose.Cells has provided [**ExportTableOptions.FormatStrategy**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/exporttableoptions/properties/formatstrategy) property which can take one of these three values

- CellValueFormatStrategy.CellStyle
- CellValueFormatStrategy.DisplayStyle
- CellValueFormatStrategy.None

If you will set it to [**CellValueFormatStrategy.None**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cellvalueformatstrategy), then it will export the data without any formatting.
