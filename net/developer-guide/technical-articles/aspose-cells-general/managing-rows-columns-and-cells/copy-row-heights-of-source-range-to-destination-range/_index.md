Sometime user needs to copy row heights of source range to destination range. Aspose.Cells provides [PasteType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pastetype).RowHeights enum for this purpose. When you will set [PasteOptions.PasteType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pasteoptions/properties/pastetype) property with [PasteType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pastetype).RowHeights enum then heights of all rows inside the source range will be copied to destination range.

Once you will open the output excel file generated by this code in Microsoft Excel, you will see that destination range row heights are exactly the same as source range row heights.
