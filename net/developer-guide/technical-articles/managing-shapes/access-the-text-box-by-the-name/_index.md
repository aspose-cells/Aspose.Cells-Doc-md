## Access the Text Box by the Name

Earlier, text boxes are accessed by index from the [**Worksheet.TextBoxes**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/textboxes)Â collection but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.

The following sample code first creates a text box and assigns it some text and name. Then in the next lines, we access the same text box by its name and print its text.
