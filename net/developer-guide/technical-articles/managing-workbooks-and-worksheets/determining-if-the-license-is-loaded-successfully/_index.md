Aspose.Cells provides [**Workbook.IsLicensed**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook/properties/islicensed) property which you can use to determine if the license is loaded successfully or not. If you access this property before setting the license, it will return **false** and if you will call this property after setting the license, it will return **true** indicating that license has been loaded successfully.
