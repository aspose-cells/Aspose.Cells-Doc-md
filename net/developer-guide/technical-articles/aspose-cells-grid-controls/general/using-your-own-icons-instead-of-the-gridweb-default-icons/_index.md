Sometimes you might want to use your own icons (images) instead of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control's default icons. This article explains how to do this.

{{% /alert %}} 

The control’s default icons are located in the URL path "/acw_client/". The file path can be: "C:\Program Files\Aspose\Aspose.Cells for .NET\acw_client" by default. You find files like submit.gif, save.gif etc. in that folder. If you want to replace these images with your own, add a config section to the web.config file of your web application.

**XML**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 <appSettings>

 <add key="Aspose.Cells.GridWeb.acw_client_path" value="/acw_client/" />

</appSettings>



{{< /highlight >}}

You may have noticed that this configuration only affects the control images path and doesn't affect the control’s client-scripts path. For example, if you run your page with the GridWeb control and check the source file in the browser, you may find that the acw_client _path property of the grid’s DIV element still says: “/yourApp/webform1.aspx/”. In some cases, you may need to redefine the client-script path. To force the control to use the redefined image path as the client-script path, add another config setting in the appSettings section:

**XML**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 <add key="Aspose.Cells.GridWeb.force_script_path" value="true" />



{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

This config will only take effect with the licensed control.

{{% /alert %}}
