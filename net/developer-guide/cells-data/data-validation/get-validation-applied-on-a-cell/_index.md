You can use Aspose.Cells to get the validation applied to a cell. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Cell.GetValidation()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cell/methods/getvalidation) method for this purpose. If there is no validation applied on the cell, it returns null.

Similarly, you can use [**Worksheet.Validations.GetValidationInCell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/validationcollection/methods/getvalidationincell) method to acquire the validation applied to a cell by providing its row and column indices.
