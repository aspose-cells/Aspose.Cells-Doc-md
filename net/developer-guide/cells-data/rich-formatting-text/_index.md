Aspose.Cells allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of the cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell.GetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cell/methods/getcharacters/index) and [**Cell.SetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cell/methods/setcharacters) methods. These methods will return and accept the array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects which you can use to access and update various properties of font like font name, font color, boldness, etc.
