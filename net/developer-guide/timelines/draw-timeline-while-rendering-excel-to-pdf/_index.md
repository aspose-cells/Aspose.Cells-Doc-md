## **Draw Timeline while rendering Excel to PDF**
If you have an Excel file which has timeline applied to it and you want to export the Excel to PDF with the timeline settings, Aspose.Cells now supports this by default. You simply export the Excel file with timeline to PDF, the generated PDF will show the timeline applied.

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](input.xlsx) that contains an existing timeline. It then saves the workbook as [output PDF file](out.pdf). The following screenshot compares the source Excel file and the generated PDF file.
