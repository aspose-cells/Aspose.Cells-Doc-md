Aspose.Cells supports saving an ODS file (**OpenDocument Spreadsheet**) in the ODF (**OpenDocument Format**) 1.1 and 1.2 specifications. Aspose.Cells has [**OdsSaveOptions.IsStrictSchema11**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/odssaveoptions/properties/isstrictschema11) property that specifies the use of ODF 1.1 specification for saving ODS files. The default value of this property is **false**, so the ODS file saved without this setting uses the 1.2 specifications.

## **Live Example**
