# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Combine Multiple Workbooks into a Single Workbook


Sometimes, you need to combine workbooks with various content like images, charts and data into a single workbook. Aspose.Cells supports this feature. This article shows how to create a console application in Visual Studio and combine workbooks with a few, simple lines of code using Aspose.Cells.

## Combining Workbooks with Images and Charts

The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [Workbook.combine()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbook/methods/combine) method to combine them and saves the output workbook.
