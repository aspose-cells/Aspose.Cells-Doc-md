Aspose.Cells for Java : Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS - HSSF and XSSF  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS - HSSF and XSSF


## Introduction

### Apache POI SS - HSSF and XSSF

**HSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel '97(-2007) file format.  
**XSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format.

HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets. They provide:

*   low level structures for those with special needs
*   an eventmodel api for efficient read-only access
*   a full usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying XLS files

### Aspose.Cells for Java

Aspose.Cells for Java is an award-winning Excel Spreadsheet component that allows Java developers to embed the ability to read, write and manipulate Excel® spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, XLTX, SpreadsheetML, CSV, ODS), HTML, MHTML, PDF and image file formats into their own Java applications without needing to rely on Microsoft Excel®.

Aspose.Cells for Java is a mature, scalable and feature rich component that offers many functions that are way beyond the simple data exporting capabilities of other vendors. With Aspose.Cells for Java developers can export data, format spreadsheets to the most granular level, import images, create charts, apply and calculate complex formulas, stream Excel® data, save in various formats and much more - all this without the need of Microsoft Excel® or Microsoft Office Automation.

### Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS - HSSF and XSSF

Project Aspose.Cells for Apache POI HSSF and XSSF shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells Java APIs in comparison with Apache POI SS. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Cells APIs but not in Apache POI SS for dealing with spreadsheets.

This project is helpful for developers who want to compare Apache POI HSSF and XSSF with Aspose.Cells OR migrate from Apache POI SS to Aspose.Cells.
