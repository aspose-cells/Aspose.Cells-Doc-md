# Aspose.Cells for Java : Get Worksheet of the Chart


Sometimes, you want to access a worksheet from a chart's reference. Aspose.Cells provides the [Chart.getWorksheet()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property which returns the reference of the worksheet that contains the chart.

#### Example

The following example shows how to use the [Chart.getWorksheet()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property. The code first prints the name of the worksheet, then accesses the first chart on the worksheet. It then prints the worksheet name again, using the [Chart.getWorksheet()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property.

Below is the console output the sample code results in. As you can see, it prints the same worksheet name both times.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Sheet Name: Portfolio
Chart's Sheet Name: Portfolio
{{< /code >}}
