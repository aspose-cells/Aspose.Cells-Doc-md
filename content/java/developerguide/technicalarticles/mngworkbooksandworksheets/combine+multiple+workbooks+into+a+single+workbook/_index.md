# Aspose.Cells for Java : Combine Multiple Workbooks into a Single Workbook


Sometimes, you need to combine workbooks with various content like images, charts, and data into a single workbook. Aspose.Cells supports this feature. This article shows how to create a simple application to combine workbooks with a few, simple lines of code using Aspose.Cells.

### Combining Workbooks

The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells for Java. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [Workbook.combine()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/workbook#combine(com.aspose.cells.Workbook))Â method to combine them and saves the output workbook.

#### Source Workbooks

*   [charts.xlsx](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276659/5473097.xlsx)
*   [picture.xlsx](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276659/5473096.xlsx)

#### Output Workbooks

#### Screenshots

Below are screenshots of the source and output workbooks.

You can use any source workbooks. These images are just for illustration purposes.
