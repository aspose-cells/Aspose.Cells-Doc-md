# Aspose.Cells for Java : Verify Password Used to Protect the Worksheet


Aspose.Cells APIs have enhanced the [Protection](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Protection) class by introducing some useful properties & methods. One such method is the [verifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword(java.lang.String)) which allows specifying a password as an instance of `String` and verifies if the same password has been used to protect the Worksheet.

### Verify Password Used to Protect the Worksheet

The [Protection.verifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword(java.lang.String)) method returns **true **if the specified password matches with the password used to protect the given worksheet, **false **if the specified password does not match. Following piece of code uses the [Protection.verifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword(java.lang.String)) method in conjunction with [Protection.isProtectedWithPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/protection#IsProtectedWithPassword) property to detect the password protection, and verifies the password.
