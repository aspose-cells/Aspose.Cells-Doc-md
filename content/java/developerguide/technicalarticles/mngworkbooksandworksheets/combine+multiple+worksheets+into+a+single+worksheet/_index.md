# Aspose.Cells for Java : Combine Multiple Worksheets into a Single Worksheet


Sometimes, you need to combine multiple worksheets into a single worksheet. This can easily be achieved using Aspose.Cells API. This article will show you a code example that reads a source workbook and combines the data of all source worksheets into a single worksheet inside a destination workbook.

### Combining Worksheets

The sample below uses the [Range.copy()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/range#copy(com.aspose.cells.Range))Â method to copy all source worksheets into a single sheet inside a destination workbook.

#### Source Workbook

You can use any source workbook. For this example, we are using a source workbook which has three worksheets.

**Worksheet 1**

**Worksheet 2**

**Worksheet 3**

#### Output Workbook

Running the following code provides a workbook with a single worksheet containing the data of all three worksheets.

**The output worksheet now contains the data of all 3 source worksheets**
