# Aspose.Cells for Java : Get the Version Number of the Application that Created the Excel Document


Often you need to know the version number of the application that created a Microsoft Excel document. Aspose.Cells provides the [Workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/builtindocumentpropertycollection#Version) property for this purpose.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [Workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/builtindocumentpropertycollection#Version)Â property. It loads Excel files created with Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 and prints the version number of the application that created these Excel documents.

For your reference, below is the console output the sample code creates.
