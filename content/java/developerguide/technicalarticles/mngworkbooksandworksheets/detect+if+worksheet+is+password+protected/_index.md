# Aspose.Cells for Java : Detect if Worksheet is Password Protected


It is possible to protect the workbooks and worksheets separately. For instance, a spreadsheet may contain one or more worksheets that are password-protected, however, the spreadsheet itself may or may not be protected. Aspose.Cells APIs provide the means to detect if a given worksheet is password protected or not. This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Cells for Java API to achieve the same.
