# Aspose.Cells for Java : Using WorkbookMetadata


Aspose.Cells allows you to load a light-weight version of the workbook into memory to edit its metadata information. Please use the [com.aspose.cells.WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/WorkbookMetadata) class to load the workbook.

#### Using WorkbookMetadata

The following sample code uses [WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/WorkbookMetadata) class to edit custom document properties of a workbook. Once you open the workbook using [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) class, you will be able to read the document properties.

Here is a sample code using the [WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/WorkbookMetadata)Â class.
