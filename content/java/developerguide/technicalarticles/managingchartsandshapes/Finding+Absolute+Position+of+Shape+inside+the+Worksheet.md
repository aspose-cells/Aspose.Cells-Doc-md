# Aspose.Cells for Java : Finding Absolute Position of Shape inside the Worksheet


Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape on a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.getLeftToCorner()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#LeftToCorner) and [Shape.getTopToCorner()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#TopToCorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet in pixels.

#### Explanation of the Shape.getLeftToCorner() and Shape.getTopToCorner() properties

This screenshot explains what distances the [Shape.getLeftToCorner()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#LeftToCorner) and [Shape.getTopToCorner()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#TopToCorner) properties measure.
