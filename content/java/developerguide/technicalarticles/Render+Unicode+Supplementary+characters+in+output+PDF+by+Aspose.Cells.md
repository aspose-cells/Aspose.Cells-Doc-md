Aspose.Cells for Java : Render Unicode Supplementary characters in output PDF by Aspose.Cells  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Render Unicode Supplementary characters in output PDF by Aspose.Cells


Normal Unicode characters are 2-bytes long while Unicode Supplementary characters are 4-bytes long. Aspose.Cells now supports rendering of these 4-bytes Unicode characters.

In the Unicode Character Standard, Supplementary Characters are the characters assigned code points from U+10000 to U+10FFFF. In other words, these are the Unicode characters greater than U+FFFF.

*   In UTF-8 these characters are each 4 bytes long.
*   In UTF-16 these characters require 2 surrogates (16-bit units).

The following screenshot shows how Aspose.Cells rendered the [source excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276130/5473390.xlsx) into the [output PDF](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276130/5473391.pdf). As you can see all three Unicode Supplementary characters have been rendered exactly the same as done by Microsoft Excel.
