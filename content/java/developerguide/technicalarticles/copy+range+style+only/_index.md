# Aspose.Cells for Java : Copy Range Style Only


[Copy Range Data Only](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/technicalarticles/copy+range+data+only) and [Copy Range Data with Style](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/technicalarticles/copy+range+data+with+style) explained how to copy data from a range to another with or without formatting. It is also possible to copy only the formatting of the range. This article shows how.
