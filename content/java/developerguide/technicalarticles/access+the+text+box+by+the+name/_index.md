# Aspose.Cells for Java : Access the Text Box by the Name


Earlier, text boxes are accessed by index from the [Workheet.getTextBoxes()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/worksheet#TextBoxes) collection but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.

#### Access the Text Box by the Name

The following sample code first creates a text box and assigns it some text and name. Then in the next lines, we access the same text box by its name and print its text.


#### Console Output

Here is the console output of the above sample code.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
This is MyTextBox
{{< /code >}}
