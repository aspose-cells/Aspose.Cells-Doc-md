Aspose.Cells for Java : Adding HTML Rich Text inside the Cell  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Adding HTML Rich Text inside the Cell


Aspose.Cells supports converting Microsoft Excel oriented HTML into XLS/XLSX format. It means, the HTML generated by Microsoft Excel can be converted back to XLS/XLSX format using Aspose.Cells.

Similarly, if there is some simple HTML, Aspose.Cells can convert it into HTML Rich Text. Aspose.Cells provides [Cell.setHtmlString()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cell#HtmlString) property which can take such a simple HTML and convert it to formatted cell text.

#### Example

The following screenshot shows the output Excel file generated with Aspose.Cells. As you can see, it shows HTML formatted rich text added inside the cell A1 using the [Cell.setHtmlString()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cell#HtmlString)Â property.
