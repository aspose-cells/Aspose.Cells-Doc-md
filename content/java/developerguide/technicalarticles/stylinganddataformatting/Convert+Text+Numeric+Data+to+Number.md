# Aspose.Cells for Java : Convert Text Numeric Data to Number


Sometimes, you want to convert numeric data entered as text to numbers. You can enter numbers as text in Microsoft Excel by putting an apostrophe before a number, for example **'12345**. Excel then treats the number as a string. Aspose.Cells allows you to convert strings to numbers.
