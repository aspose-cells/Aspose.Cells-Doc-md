Aspose.Cells for Java : Release Unmanaged Resources of the Workbook  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Release Unmanaged Resources of the Workbook


Aspose.Cells provides [Workbook.dispose()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/workbook#dispose()) method to release the unmanaged resources of the [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Workbook) object. The dispose pattern is used only for objects that access unmanaged resources, such as file and pipe handles, registry handles, wait handles or pointers to blocks of unmanaged memory. This is because the garbage collector is very efficient at reclaiming unused managed objects, but it is unable to reclaim unmanaged objects.
