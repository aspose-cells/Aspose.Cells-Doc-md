# Aspose.Cells for Java : Implementing Non-Sequential Ranges


Normally, [named ranges](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/data/named+ranges) are rectangular with cells continuous and adjacent to each other. But sometimes, you may need to use a non-sequential cell range in which cells are not adjacent. Aspose.Cells supports creating a named range with non-adjacent cells.

The code sample below shows how to create a named non-sequential range with Aspose.Cells for Java.
