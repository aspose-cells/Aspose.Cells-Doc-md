# Aspose.Cells for Java : Copy Range Data with Style


[Copy Range Data Only](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/technicalarticles/copy+range+data+only) explained how to copy the data from a range of cells to another range. Aspose.Cells can also copy a range complete with formatting. This article explains how.

#### Copy Range Data with Style

Aspose.Cells provides a range of classes and methods for working with ranges, for example, [createRange()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cells#createRange(int,%20int,%20boolean)), [StyleFlag](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/StyleFlag), [applyStyle()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cells#applyStyle(com.aspose.cells.Style,%20com.aspose.cells.StyleFlag)), etc.

This example:

1.  Creates a workbook.
2.  Fills a number of cells in the first worksheet with data.
3.  Creates a range.
4.  Creates a style object with specified formatting attributes.
5.  Applies the style to the data range.
6.  Creates a second range of cells.
7.  Copies data with the formatting from the first range to the second range.
