# Aspose.Cells for Java : Load Workbook with specified Printer Paper Size


You can specify the printer paper size of your choice while loading your workbook using the [LoadOptions.setPaperSize()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/loadoptions#setPaperSize(int)) method. Please note, if you create a new file in MS Excel, you will find the paper size is the same as the setting of default printer in your machine.

#### Load Workbook with specified Printer Paper Size

The following sample code illustrates the usage of [LoadOptions.setPaperSize()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/loadoptions#setPaperSize(int))Â method. It first creates a workbook, then saves it in byte array stream in XLSX format. Then it loads it with A5 paper size and saves it in PDF format. Then it loads it again with A3 paper size and saves it again in PDF format. If you open the output PDFs and check their paper size, you will see they are different. One is A5 and the other is A3. Please download the [A5 output PDF](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276078/5473435.pdf) and [A3 output PDF](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/5276078/5473436.pdf) generated by the code for your reference.
