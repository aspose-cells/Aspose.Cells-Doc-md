# Aspose.Cells for Java : Assign Macro Code to Form Control


Aspose.Cells allows you to assign a Macro Code to a Form Control like a Button. Please use the [ShapeCollection.addShape()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapecollection#addShape(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)) method to assign a new Macro Code to a Form Control inside the workbook.

#### Assigning Macro Code to Form Control using Aspose.Cells

The following sample code creates a new workbook, assign a Macro Code to a Form Buttom and saves the output in the XLSM format. Once, you will open the output XLSM file in Microsoft Excel you will see the following macro code.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Sub ShowMessage()
    MsgBox "Welcome to Aspose!"
End Sub
{{< /code >}}
