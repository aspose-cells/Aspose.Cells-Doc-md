Aspose.Cells for Java : Change the HTML Link Target Type  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Change the HTML Link Target Type


Aspose.Cells allows you to change the HTML link target type. HTML link looks like this

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<a href="http://www.aspose.com/" target="_self">
{{< /code >}}

As you can see the target attribute in the above HTML link is **\_self**. You can control this target attribute using the [HtmlSaveOptions.setLinkTargetType()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#LinkTargetType) property. This property takes the [HtmlLinkTargetType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/HtmlLinkTargetType) enum which has the following values.

*   [BLANK](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/htmllinktargettype#BLANK)
*   [PARENT](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/htmllinktargettype#PARENT)
*   [SELF](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/htmllinktargettype#SELF)
*   [TOP](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/htmllinktargettype#TOP)
