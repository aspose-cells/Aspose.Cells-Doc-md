# Aspose.Cells for Java : Create Table by Using Border Lines for a Range


Sometimes, you want to create a table by adding border lines for a **Range**/**CellArea** based on the address of the cells you have. You can use [Cells.createRange](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cells#createRange(int,%20int,%20boolean)) method to create a range of cells. The [Cells.createRange](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/cells#createRange(int,%20int,%20boolean))Â method returns a [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Range)object. You can create a [Style](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Style)object and specify the borders (top, left, bottom, right) options accordingly. Later, you may get the cells of the [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Range)and apply your desired formatting to the cells.

##### *Example:  
*

The following example shows how to create a [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/Range)and specify the borderlines for the range cells.


After running the above code, we can have the generated excel file containing the formatted table; here is the screenshot of the file.
