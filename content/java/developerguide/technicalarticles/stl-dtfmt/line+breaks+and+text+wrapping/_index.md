# Aspose.Cells for Java : Line Breaks and Text Wrapping


To ensure that text in a cell can be read, explicit line breaks and text wrapping can be applied. Text wrapping turns one line into several in a cell, which explicit line breaks put in breaks exactly where you want them.

### To Wrap Text in a Cell

To wrap text in a cell, use the [Aspose.Cells.Style.setTextWrapped](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/style#IsTextWrapped) property.

The following sample code shows how to use text wrapping and explicit line breaks in a cell.


#### To Use Explicit Line Breaks

You can use ‘\\n’ in Java to insert the explicit line breaks in a cell.
