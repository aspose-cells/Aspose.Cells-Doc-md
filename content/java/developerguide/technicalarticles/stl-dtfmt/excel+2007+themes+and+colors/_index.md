# Aspose.Cells for Java : Excel 2007 Themes and Colors


Themes provide a unified look with named styles, graphical effects and other objects used in a workbook. For example, the Accent1 style looks different in the Office and the Apex themes. Often, you apply a document theme and then amend it as per your needs.
