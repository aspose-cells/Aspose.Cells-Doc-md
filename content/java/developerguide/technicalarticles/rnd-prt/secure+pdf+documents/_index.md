# Aspose.Cells for Java : Secure PDF Documents


Sometimes, developers need to work with encrypted PDF files. For example, they need to secure documents with user and owner passwords so not just anyone can open them, or want to restrict whether the document content can be printed or extracted.

This article explains how to pass in PDF security options when saving spreadsheets to PDF.

Aspose.Cells APIs provide the [PdfSecurityOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/PdfSecurityOptions)Â class for working with the security of PDF file format. The sample code below describes how to create secured PDF files with Aspose.Cells for Java API.


If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call [Workbook.calculateFormula()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/workbook#calculateFormula()) just before rendering it to PDF. This ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
