# Aspose.Cells for Java : Limit the Number of Pages Generated - Excel to PDF Conversion


Sometimes, you want to print a range of pages to an output PDF file. Aspose.Cells has the ability to set a limit on how many pages are generated when converting an Excel spreadsheet to PDF.

### Limiting the Number of Pages Generated

The following example shows how to render a range of pages (3 and 4) in a Microsoft Excel file to PDF.


If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call [Workbook.calculateFormula](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/workbook#calculateFormula())Â just before rendering it to PDF format. Doing so ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the output file.
