# Aspose.Cells for Java : Create Transparent Image of Excel Worksheet


Sometimes, you need to generate the image of your worksheet as a transparent image. You want to apply transparency to all cells which have no fill colors. Aspose.Cells provides the [ImageOrPrintOptions.setTransparent()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/imageorprintoptions#Transparent) property to apply transparency to worksheet image. When this property is **false**, then cells with no fill colors are drawn with white color and when it is **true**, cells with no fill colors are drawn transparent.

In the following worksheet image, transparency has not been applied. The cells with no fill colors are drawn white.
