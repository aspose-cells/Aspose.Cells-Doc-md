# Aspose.Cells for Java : Add ActiveX Controls using Aspose.Cells


You can add ActiveX controls with Aspose.Cells using the [ShapeCollection.addActiveXControl()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapecollection#addActiveXControl(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)) method. This method takes a parameter [ControlType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/ControlType)Â which tells what type of ActiveX control needs to be added inside a worksheet. It has the following values.

*   [CHECK\_BOX](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#CHECK_BOX)
*   [COMBO\_BOX](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#COMBO_BOX)
*   [COMMAND\_BUTTON](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#COMMAND_BUTTON)
*   [IMAGE](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#IMAGE)
*   [LABEL](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#LABEL)
*   [LIST\_BOX](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#LIST_BOX)
*   [RADIO\_BUTTON](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#RADIO_BUTTON)
*   [SCROLL\_BAR](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#SCROLL_BAR)
*   [SPIN\_BUTTON](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#SPIN_BUTTON)
*   [TEXT\_BOX](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#TEXT_BOX)
*   [TOGGLE\_BUTTON](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#TOGGLE_BUTTON)
*   [UNKNOWN](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/controltype#UNKNOWN)

Once, you have added the ActiveX control inside the shape collection, you can then access the ActiveX control object via [Shape.ActiveXControl](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#ActiveXControl) property and then set its various properties.
