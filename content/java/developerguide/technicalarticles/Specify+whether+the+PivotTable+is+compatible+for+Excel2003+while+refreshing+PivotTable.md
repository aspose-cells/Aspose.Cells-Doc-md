# Aspose.Cells for Java : Specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable


Aspose.Cells provides the [PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/pivottable#IsExcel2003Compatible) property which you can use to specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable. If **true**, a string must be less than or equal to 255 characters, so if the string is greater than 255 characters, it will be truncated. If **false**, a string will not have the aforementioned restriction. The default value is **true**.

#### Specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable

The following sample code explains the usage of [PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/pivottable#IsExcel2003Compatible) property.
