Aspose.Cells for Java : Add a Picture to an Excel Comment  

# Aspose.Cells for Java : Add a Picture to an Excel Comment


Microsoft Excel lets users customize the look and feel of spreadsheets to a great extent. It is even possible to add background pictures to comments.

Comments are added to cells to record comments, anything from the details of how a formula is worked, where a value comes from or questions from reviewers. Adding a background image can be an aesthetic choice, or be used to strengthen branding.

#### Microsoft Excel

With Microsoft Excel 2007, it is possible to have an image as the background to a cell comment. In Excel 2007, this is accomplished (supposing the comment has already been added) this way:

1.  Right-click the cell which contains the comment.
2.  Choose **Show/Hide Comments** and clear any text from the comment.
3.  Click on the border of the comment to select it.
4.  Choose **Format**, then **Comment**.
5.  On the Colors and Lines tab, click the arrow for **Color**.
6.  Click **Fill Effects**.
7.  On the Picture tab, click **Select Picture**.
8.  Locate and select the picture
9.  Click **OK**.

#### Aspose.Cells

Aspose.Cells provides this valuable feature.

The sample code below creates an XLSX file from scratch, and adds a comment with a picture background to cell A1.

After executing the code, A1 has a comment with a background image.
