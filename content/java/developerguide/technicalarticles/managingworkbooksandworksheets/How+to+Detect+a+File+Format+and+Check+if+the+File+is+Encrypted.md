# Aspose.Cells for Java : How to Detect a File Format and Check if the File is Encrypted


Sometimes you need to detect a file's format before opening it because the file extension does not guarantee that the file content is appropriate. The file might be encrypted (a password-protected file) so it can't be read it directly, or we should not read it. Aspose.Cells provides the [FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/fileformatutil#detectFileFormat(java.io.InputStream)) static method and some relevant APIs which you can use to process documents.

#### Example

The following sample code illustrates how to detect a file format (using the file path) and check its extension. You can also determine whether the file is encrypted.
