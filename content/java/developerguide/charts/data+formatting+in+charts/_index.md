# Aspose.Cells for Java : Data Formatting in Charts

In our previous topics, we have already provided many examples to demonstrate that how can you set a data source for your chart but in this topic, we are going to provide more details about the types of data that can be set for a chart.

### Setting Chart Data

There are two types of data to deal with while working on charts using Aspose.Cells as follows:

*   [Chart data](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/charts/data+formatting+in+charts).
*   [Category data](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/developerguide/charts/data+formatting+in+charts).

#### Chart Data

Chart data is that data that we use as a data source to build our charts. We can add a range of the cells (containing chart data) by calling the [SeriesCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/SeriesCollection) object's [Add](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/seriescollection#add(java.lang.Object)) method.

#### Category Data

Category data is used for the labeling of chart data and can be added to [SeriesCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/SeriesCollection) by using its [setCategoryData](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/seriescollection#CategoryData) method.
