# Working with ContentTypeProperties

Aspose.Cells provides [Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/contenttypepropertycollection#add(java.lang.Object)) method to add custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. You may also make the property optional by setting the [ContentTypeProperty.IsNillable](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/contenttypeproperty#IsNillable) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
