# Aspose.Cells for Java : Evaluate Aspose.Cells


You can easily download Aspose.Cells for evaluation from the [download page](http://maven.aspose.com/repository/simple/ext-release-local/com/aspose/aspose-cells/) @ maven repos. The evaluation download is same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you add a few lines of code to apply the license.

Evaluation version of Aspose.Cells (without a license specified) provides product functionality to some extent not complete though. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with evaluation watermark on open / save any spreadsheet document.

If you want to test Aspose.Cells without evaluation version limitations, you may [request a 30-day temporary license](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/faqs/temporary-license.aspx).
