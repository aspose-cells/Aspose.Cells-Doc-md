## Possible Usage Scenarios

Earlier, Aspose.Cells would create [PdfBookmarkEntry](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for a normal sheet. But now Aspose.Cells can also create [PdfBookmarkEntry](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for chart sheet. Since chart sheet does not have any other cell except cell A1, so it will create [PdfBookmarkEntry](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/PdfBookmarkEntry) for cell A1 only. 

## Create PdfBookmarkEntry for Chart Sheet

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/61540759/61767772.xlsx) which has four sheets. Two of them are normal sheets and the other two are chart sheets. It creates four bookmark entries as follows

*   Bookmark-I
*   Bookmark-II-Chart1
*   Bookmark-III
*   Bookmark-IV-Chart2

The following screenshot shows the [output PDF](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/61540759/61767771.pdf) generated by the sample code for a reference.
