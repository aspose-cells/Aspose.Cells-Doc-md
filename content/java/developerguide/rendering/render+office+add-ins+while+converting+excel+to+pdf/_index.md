## Possible Usage Scenarios

Earlier, Aspose.Cells could not render Office Add-Ins when Excel file is saved to PDF format. Now Aspose.Cells renders it fine. You do not need to use any special method or property to render Office Add-Ins in output PDF. Just save your Excel file to PDF format and it will render Office Add-Ins.

## Render Office Add-Ins while converting Excel to PDF

The following sample code saves the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/60229066/60489783.xlsx) which contains the Office Add-Ins. Please see the [output PDF generated with the previous version i.e. 17.11](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/60229066/60489781.pdf) and the [output PDF generated with newer version i.e. 17.12 and onward](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/60229066/60489782.pdf). The previous version output PDF is blank but the newer version output PDF shows the Office Add-In.
