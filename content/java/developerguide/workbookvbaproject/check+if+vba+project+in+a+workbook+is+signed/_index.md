# Aspose.Cells for Java : Check if VBA project in a Workbook is Signed


You can check if your VBA project is signed or not using Microsoft Excel via **Tools > Digital Signatures...** menu command. Similarly, you can check it programmatically using Aspose.Cells [Workbook.getVbaProject().isSigned()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/vbaproject#IsSigned) method.

#### Check if VBA project in a Workbook is Signed

The following code loads the workbook and checks if its VBA project is signed using [Workbook.getVbaProject().isSigned()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/vbaproject#IsSigned)Â property. The property will return **true** if the project is signed otherwise it will return **false**.
