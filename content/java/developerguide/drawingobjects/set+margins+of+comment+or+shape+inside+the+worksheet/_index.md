## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [Shape.TextBody.TextAlignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/fontsettingcollection#TextAlignment) property. This property returns the object of [ShapeTextAlignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/ShapeTextAlignment) class which has different properties e.g. [TopMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapetextalignment#TopMarginPt), [LeftMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapetextalignment#LeftMarginPt), [BottomMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapetextalignment#BottomMarginPt), [RightMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shapetextalignment#RightMarginPt), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom and right margins.

## Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/61542579/61767867.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/61542579/61767866.xlsx) generated by the code and screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.
