## Possible Usage Scenarios

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location then how will they be visible is decided by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells provides [Shape.ToFrontOrBack()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#toFrontOrBack(int)) method which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send shape to back you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. and if you want to send shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.

## Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet

The following sample code explains the usage of [Shape.ToFrontOrBack()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#toFrontOrBack(int)) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/50270497/50528362.xlsx) used inside the code and the [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/50270497/50528361.xlsx) generated by it.
