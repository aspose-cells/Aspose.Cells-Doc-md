## Possible Usage Scenarios

Smart Art Shapes are special shapes in Microsoft Excel that allow you to create complex diagrams automatically. You can find if the shape is a smart art shape or normal shape using [](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#IsSmartArt)[Shape.IsSmartArt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#IsSmartArt) property.

## Determine if Shape is Smart Art Shape

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/54690182/55541805.xlsx) containing a smart art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then prints the value of [Shape.IsSmartArt](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#IsSmartArt) property of the first shape. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
