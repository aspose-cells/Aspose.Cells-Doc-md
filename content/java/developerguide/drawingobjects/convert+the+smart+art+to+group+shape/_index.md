## Possible Usage Scenarios

You can convert Smart Art Shape into Group Shape using the [Shape.getResultOfSmartArt()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#getResultOfSmartArt()) method. It will enable you to handle smart art shape like a group shape. Consequently, you will have access to the individual parts or shapes of the group shape.

## Convert the Smart Art to Group Shape

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/java/attachments/54690193/55541806.xlsx) containing a smart art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then converts the smart art shape into group shape and prints the [Shape.IsGroup](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/shape#IsGroup) property. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
