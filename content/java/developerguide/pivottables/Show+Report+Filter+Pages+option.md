## Show report filter pages option

As a result of this option, the created workbook contains more worksheets. It splits every possible value of the report filter in a separate worksheet. In this example, it has a filter on "Position" and data have three distinct positions (A, B, C). This feature adds 3 additional worksheets named A, B, C which are the same pivot table but with preselected option A, B, and C.
