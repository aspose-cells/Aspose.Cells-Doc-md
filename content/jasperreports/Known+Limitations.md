Aspose.Cells for JasperReports : Known Limitations  

# Aspose.Cells for JasperReports : Known Limitations


The following is a list of features that are not currently supported by Aspose.Cells for JasperReports:

*   **No automatic installer**. Aspose.Cells for JasperReports is distributed as a ZIP archive. [To install](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/jasperreports/installation/), extract and copy files into the appropriate location and possibly edit some XML configuration files. An automatic installer will be provided in the future.

*   **Excel doesn't support all JasperReports chart types**. Some types of charts in JasperReports are incompatible with Microsoft Excel charts, for example: XYBarChart, XYAreaChart, ThermometerChart, CandlestickChart, HighLowChart, MultipleAxisChart and MeterChart. These charts are exported as images, the same way the original JasperReports XLS exporter manages charts. (Other charts are exported as editable charts.)
