# Aspose.Cells for JasperReports : Evaluate Aspose.Cells


You can easily download Aspose.Cells for JasperReports for evaluation from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.cells-for-jasperreports/default.aspx). The evaluation download is same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed after [applying a license](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/jasperreports/gettingstarted/licensing).

Evaluation version of Aspose.Cells for JasperReports (without a license specified) provides product functionality to some extent not complete though. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with evaluation watermark on open / save any spreadsheet document.
