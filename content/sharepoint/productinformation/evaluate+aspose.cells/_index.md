# Aspose.Cells for SharePoint : Evaluate Aspose.Cells


The evaluation version of Aspose.Cells for SharePoint has no time limit and free technical support is available for evaluation users too.

The download for both evaluation and full versions of Aspose.Cells for SharePoint is the same. Simply download Aspose.Cells for SharePoint from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.cells-for-sharepoint/default.aspx) and [install it](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/sharepoint/productinformation/install/). Aspose.Cells works in evaluation mode by default.

### Evaluation Version Limitations

Evaluation mode adds an evaluation warning into any exported documents. When you have purchased a license, simply [install the license](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/sharepoint/productinformation/license/installing+aspose.cells+for+sharepoint+license) and it will work in licensed mode.
