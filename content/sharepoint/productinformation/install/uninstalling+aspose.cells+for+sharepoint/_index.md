# Aspose.Cells for SharePoint : Uninstalling Aspose.Cells for SharePoint


To uninstall Aspose.Cells for SharePoint, run the setup program. If Aspose.Cells for SharePoint is already installed, the setup program suggests removing or repairing it.

### Uninstallation

During removal, the setup program deactivates Aspose.Cells for SharePoint for all site collections and retracts the solution from the server farm.

Please note that running the **Repair** option does not re-activate Aspose.Cells for SharePoint on site collections. Instead, the feature must be activated manually after re-deployment with the **Repair** option.

Uninstalling using the **Remove** option and then re-installing may be more convenient as it allows you to select target web applications and site collections during installation.
