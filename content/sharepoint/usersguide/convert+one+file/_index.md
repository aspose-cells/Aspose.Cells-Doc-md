# Aspose.Cells for SharePoint : Convert One File


One of the most common tasks that users use Aspose.Cells for, is converting individual files.

### Converting Individual Files

To convert a particular document in a document library:

1.  Select **Convert with Aspose.Cells.SharePoint** in the document's Edit Control Block (ECB).  
      
    **Selecting “Convert via Aspose.Cells” item in the document’s ECB**

    The conversion settings screen is displayed. Here, you can fine-tune the conversion:
2.  Select the destination file format from the **Convert to** list.
3.  Enter the output file's name into the **Destination file** field.  
    By default, Aspose.Cells for SharePoint pre-populates this field with the name of the source file.  
    The extension is added automatically according to the selected format.
4.  Start the conversion by clicking **Convert**.  
    (Or go back to the library, dismissing your settings, by clicking **Cancel**.)
