### A Brief Note on SharePoint Document Libraries

The contents on SharePoint sites are in the form of documents shared at a centralized location called a SharePoint document library (sometimes known as a "shared document library"). Authorized users can upload documents from their local machine to the SharePoint site. These documents are stored in binary format in an SQL Server database used by the SharePoint site. Documents become available to other SharePoint users in the form of a list of hyperlinks as shown below:
