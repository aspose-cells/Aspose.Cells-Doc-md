## Managing Document Properties

The following sample code loads [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970896/23166989.xlsx) and reads the built-in document properties e.g. *Title, Subject* and then changes them. Then it also reads the custom document property i.e. *MyCustom1 *and then adds a new custom document property i.e. *MyCustom5 *and writes the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970896/23166986.xlsx). The following screenshot shows the effect of the sample code on the sample excel file.
