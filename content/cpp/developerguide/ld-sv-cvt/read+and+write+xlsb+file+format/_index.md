## Possible Usage Scenarios

Microsoft Excel supports many formats like XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, CSV, etc. Aspose.Cells also supports many of these formats. This article explains how to read and write the excel file having XLSB format using Aspose.Cells.

## Read and Write XLSB File Format

The following sample code loads the [source XLSB file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970901/23166992.xlsb) and reads its `cell A1` and then copies its contents to `cell C4` and saves it as [output XLSB file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970901/23166993.xlsb).
