## Possible Usage Scenarios

Microsoft Excel supports many formats like XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, CSV, tab-delimited, etc. Aspose.Cells also supports many of these formats. This article explains how to read and write the excel file having Tab Delimited format using Aspose.Cells.

## Read and Write Tab Delimited File Format

The following sample code loads the [source tab-delimited file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970906/23166997.txt) and reads its cell A1 and then copies its contents to cell C4 and saves it as [output tab-delimited file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970906/23166996.txt).
