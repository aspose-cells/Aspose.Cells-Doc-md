## Possible Usage Scenario

Aspose.Cells allows you to add all sorts of Conditional Formatting e.g. Formula, Above Average, Color Scale, Data Bar, Icon Set, Top10, etc. It provides the [IFormatCondition](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/) class which has all the necessary methods to apply conditional formatting of your choice. Here is the list of a few of Get methods.

*   [GetIAboveAverage()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/#aff550fd834cd78967ec440492ff012d5)
*   [GetIColorScale()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/#a3348a7c447dc564ceabc22c9c89bd6f5)
*   [GetIDataBar()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/#a4415a87833c41386ed1595e742485e07)
*   [GetIIconSet()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/#a011b2c7dbaaf671819d09f5d1df865e3)
*   [GetITop10()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_format_condition/#a64388aaf1b43811f5ee1ee3090c9bd4a)

## Apply Conditional Formatting in Worksheet

The following sample code shows how to add a Cell Value conditional formatting on cells A1 and B2. Please see the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970923/23167004.xlsx) generated by the code and the following screenshot which explains the effect of the code on the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970923/23167004.xlsx). If you will put some value greater than 100 in cell A2 and B2, the Red fill color from cell A1 and B2 will disappear.
