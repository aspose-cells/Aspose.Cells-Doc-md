## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells supports the creation of a named range. There are different ways to create a named range. One of the simplest ways is to first create [IRange](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_range/) object and then set its name using [IRange.SetName()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_range/#a78480b6b6db0f24cffc8acc2b06552eb) method. You can see all the named ranges inside your excel file via Microsoft Excel *Name Manager *interface.

## Create Named Range in a Workbook

The following sample code explains how to create a *Named Range* via Aspose.Cells. Once, the *Named Range* is created, it is visible inside the [IWorkbook.GetIWorksheets().GetINames()](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_worksheet_collection/#aa9e7bc07917a152a2c0de161cca133fa) collection. Please see the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/cpp/attachments/22970925/23167006.xlsx) generated by the code for a reference.

## Sample Code

## Console Output

The following console output prints the values of [GetFullText](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_name/#a5b450ef193365dec035c58280fbe9563) and [GetRefersTo](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/cells/class/aspose.cells.i_name/#afdb10a12d8d395ae81de231f017eba36) methods of the created *Named Range* in the above code.
