## Introduction

Sometimes you create a table in Microsoft Excel and do not want to keep working with the table functionality that it comes with. Instead, you want something that looks like a table. To keep data in a table without losing formatting, convert the table to a regular range of data. Aspose.Cells does support this feature of Microsoft Excel for tables and list-objects.

## Using Microsoft Excel

Use the **Convert to Range** feature to quickly convert a table to a range without losing formatting. In Microsoft Excel 2007/2010:

1.  Click anywhere in the table to make sure that the active cell is in a table column.
2.  On the **Design** tab, in the **Tools** group, click **Convert to Range**.

The table features are no longer available after the table has been converted to a range. For example, row headers no longer include the sort and filter arrows, and structured references (references that use table names) that were used in formulas turn into regular cell references.

## Using Aspose.Cells

The following code snippet demonstrates the same functionality using Aspose.Cells.
