## Get Cell Name from Row and Column Indices

It is possible to find a cell's name given the row and column index. This article explains how.  
Aspose.Cells provides the `ICellsHelper.CellIndexToName_i` method which allows developers to get a cell's name if they provide the row and column index.

Unlike Microsoft Excel, where row and column indices start from 1, Aspose.Cells starts counting row and column indices from 0.

The following sample code illustrates how to use `ICellsHelper.CellIndexToName_i` to access the a cell's name given a known row and column index. The code generates the following output.
