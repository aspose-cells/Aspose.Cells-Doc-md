# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Evaluate Aspose.Cells


You can easily download Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services for evaluation from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/52/ssrs-rendering-extensions/aspose.cells-for-reporting-services/default.aspx). The evaluation download is same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed after [applying a license](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices/gettingstarted/licensing).

Evaluation version of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services (without a license specified) provides product functionality to some extent not complete though. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with evaluation watermark on open / save any spreadsheet document.
