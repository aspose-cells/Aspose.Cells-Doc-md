### Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to combine numbers, numeric variables, numeric fields and numeric functions to get another number. Comparison operators are usually used to compare operands for a condition in a control structure such as an If statement. Boolean operators are typically used with comparison operators to generate conditions for control structures.
