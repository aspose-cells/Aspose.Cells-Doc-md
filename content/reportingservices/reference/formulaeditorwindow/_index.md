# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Formula Editor Window


The Formula Editor lets you create formulas for a report.

To edit a formula in a Microsoft Excel cell:

1.  In Microsoft Excel, select a cell.
2.  Open the Edit Formula dialog by clicking **Edit Formula** on the tool bar.  
    ([Adding Reporting Services Formulas](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices/userguide/creatingtabularreport/adding+reporting+services+formulas) walks through an example that edits a formula.)  
    The dialog is divided into section: the edit area at the top, and the formula area at the bottom. Use the formula area to populate the edit area.
3.  Select a category (user, parameters, fields etc.) from the **Report Fields** list (the left-hand list).
4.  Select the type from the **Functions** list (in the middle).
5.  Select an option from the **Operators** list (the right-hand list).
6.  Click **Insert** to add the expression to the **Edit** area.
7.  Click **Insert** when the expression is complete.  
    The formula is inserted into the cell.

The Edit Formula dialog is divided into sections, described below.

#### Edit Area

This is the area where you create or edit a formula. Create a formula by double-clicking on any of the components listed in the **Report Fields**, **Functions** or **Operators** lists. When you choose a component, the required syntax is also inserted. You can also manually enter a formula.

#### Formula Area

The formula area contains three sections, each listing information used to build a formula.

*   Report Fields - the left-hand list lists all the database fields accessible for the report. It also lists any formulas or groups already created.
*   Functions - the middle list contains functions, pre-built procedures that return values. They perform calculations such as AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, SIN, UPPERCASE and so on.
*   Operators - the “action verbs” used in formulas. Operators describe an operation or an action to take place between two or more values. Examples of operators: add, subtract, less than and greater than etc.

#### Controls

The dialog has several controls:

{{< table style="table-striped" >}}
|**Button Name**|**Description**|
|:----|:----|
|Undo|Undoes an action.|
|Paste|Pastes a character string made up of the components listed in the formula area into the edit area.|
