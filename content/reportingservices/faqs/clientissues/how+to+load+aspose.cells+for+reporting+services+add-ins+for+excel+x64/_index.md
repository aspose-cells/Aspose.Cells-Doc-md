# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : How to Load Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services Add-Ins for Excel x64


When installed, Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services is registered as a 32-bit component by default. It cannot correctly load Excel add-ins in Microsoft Excel x64. So you need re-register the Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.dll as a 64-bit component(s).
