# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Introduction


This section describes how to install and uninstall Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services.

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services can be deployed in two ways:

*   using a full MSI installer or
*   using a single DLL.

Both the installer and the DLL are available for free download at the Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services [download page](http://www.aspose.com/Community/Files/52/aspose.cells.reporting.services/default.aspx).

Using the installer has a couple of advantages:

1.  It makes all necessary entries into the system registry to expose Microsoft Excel to COM applications.
2.  It contains the demo projects that allow you to obtain code samples.
