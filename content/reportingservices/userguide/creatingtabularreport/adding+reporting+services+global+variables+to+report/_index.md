# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Adding Reporting Services Global Variables to Report


Aspose.Cells' report template supports Reporting Services' global variables as a data source for cells that contain a Reporting Services global variables marker.

[Aspose.Cells Template and Smart Markers](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices/userguide/aspose.cells+template+and+smart+markers) explains how Reporting Services Global Variables markers work. Global variables are normally placed in the text area of a table header or footer.

To add global variables to reports:

1.  Select a cell.
