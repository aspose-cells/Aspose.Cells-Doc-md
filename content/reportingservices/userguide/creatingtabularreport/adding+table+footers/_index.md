# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Adding Table Footers


To add table footers:

1.  Select the footer tag cell, directly on the left of the first column of the table, but under the table group data row (or table data row if the table does not contain a table group):

3.  Add the footer data row.  
    Footer data rows can contain static text, data markers, Reporting Services formulas and so on. Here, we've added a footer row that contains a merged static text cell and a Reporting Services formula cell.

    More than one footer data row is allowed in a table.
