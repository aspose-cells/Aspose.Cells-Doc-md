# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Gridlines


Gridlines are configured in **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** so you can control whether an exported Microsoft Excel file shows grid lines. The default value is **off**, meaning that gridlines are not displayed.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<Aspose>
...
  <DataWorkSheet> 
    <GridLine value="off"/>
  </DataWorkSheet>
...
</Aspose>
{{< /code >}}
