# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Data Sources and Queries


The first step in the procedure for designing a report in Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer is to create data sources and queries. There are two ways to do this. In the first approach, we may use an existing RDL report definition file that is created by other tools, for example utilizing Visual Studio and the file contains data sources and queries necessary for report design and data retrieval. The second way is to create new sources and queries in Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer.
