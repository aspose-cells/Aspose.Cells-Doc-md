# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Publishing Report

To publish a report to Report Server, follow the steps below:

1.  Click **Publish** ![](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices/attachments/6094975/6193200.png) on the Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer toolbar and click the **Yes** button to save the report.
