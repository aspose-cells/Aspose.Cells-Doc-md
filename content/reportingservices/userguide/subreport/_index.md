# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Sub Report


A sub-report can be embedded in a table item. The format is: `&=subreport{ReportName=your report name; parameter1 name = parameter1 value; parameter2 name = parameter2 value; ...`}

**A sub-report in a report definition**

In the example, the name of sub-report is “Sales Order Detail”. It has one parameter, SalesOrderNumber. The value of the parameter is `EmpSalesDetail.SalesOrderNumber`.

### Restrictions on Sub-Reports

1.  The sub-report should be designed with Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices Designer.
2.  The sub-report can only be embedded in the table group row, and the group row cannot contain any elements except the sub-report. Embedding a sub-report in the table detail rows or footer rows is not allowed.
3.  Currently, nesting more than one level is not supported. The sub-report can not contain an embedded report.
