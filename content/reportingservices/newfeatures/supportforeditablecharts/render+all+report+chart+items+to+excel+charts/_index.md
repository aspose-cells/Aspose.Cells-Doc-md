# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Render All Report Chart Items to Excel Charts


To render all chart items in a report as editable Excel charts:

1.  Open the **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** file.
2.  Modify the configuration parameters as follows:  
      
    
{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<Chart value="all">
</Chart>
{{< /code >}}
    

When `value` is set to “all”, all chart items are rendered as editable charts.
