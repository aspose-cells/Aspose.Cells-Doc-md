# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Render Selected Chart Items to Excel Charts


To render only some charts in a report to Excel charts:

1.  Open the **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** file.
2.  Modify the configuration parameters of the **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** file.
3.  Add the desired report configuration information.
4.  Add the information for the chart items you donâ€™t want to export as editable charts. These items are exported as static images.

For example:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<Chart >
<Report name= "Employee Sales Summary 2008">
<ChartItem name="Chart1" type="image"/>
</Report >
</Chart> 
{{< /code >}}
