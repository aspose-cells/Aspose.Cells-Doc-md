# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Mismatch Chart Types


Some chart types in the SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 report definition file are not available as Excel chart types:

*   Line-Stepped
*   Range-Plain
*   Range-Smooth
*   Range-Column
*   Range-Bar
*   Range-ErrorBar
*   Range-BoxPlot
*   Shape-Funnel

When rendering chart items that do not have equivalent options in Microsoft Excel, Aspose.Cells outputs them to images.
