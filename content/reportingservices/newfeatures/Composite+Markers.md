Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Composite Markers  

# Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services : Composite Markers


We have introduced the Composite Markers feature. Now, the user can join markers together as a composite marker by making use of concatenating char i.e., “&”. For example, *&= Parameters!ReportYear.Value & "-" &Parameters!ReportMonth.Value  &" Sales Report"*. The marker consists of two Parameter markers and two static text markers.
