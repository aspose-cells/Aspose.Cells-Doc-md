## Rendering Slicer

Aspose.Cells for Python via Java supports the rendering of slicer shape. The following code snippet loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/pythonjava/attachments/106201897/106364974.xlsx) that contains a slicer. It converts the worksheet into an image by setting the print area that covers only the slicer. The flowing image is the [output image](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/pythonjava/attachments/106201897/106364975.png) that shows the rendered slicer. As you can see, the slicer has been rendered properly it looks the same as in the sample Excel file.
