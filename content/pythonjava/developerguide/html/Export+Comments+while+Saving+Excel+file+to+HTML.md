## Export Comments while Saving Excel file to HTML

When Excel is converted to HTML, comments are not exported. Aspose.Cells for Python via Java provides the feature to export comments during Excel to HTML conversion. To achieve this, the API provides the [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property. Setting the value of [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property to **True** will export comments in the output HTML.

The following screenshot shows the output HTML file generated by the sample code snippet.
