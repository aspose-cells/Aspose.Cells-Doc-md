## Cut and Paste Cells

Aspose.Cells for Python via Java provides the ability to cut and paste cells. For this, the API provides the [insertCutCells](https://docs.aspose.com/apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/cells#insertCutCells(com.aspose.cells.Range,%20int,%20int,%20int)) method of the [Cells](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/Cells) collection. The [insertCutCells](https://docs.aspose.com/apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/cells#insertCutCells(com.aspose.cells.Range,%20int,%20int,%20int)) method accepts the following parameters.

*   [Range](https://docs.aspose.com/apireference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/Range): The range of cells to be cut.
*   Row Index: The index of the row to insert cells.
*   Column Index: The index of the column to insert cells.
*   [ShiftType](https://apireference.aspose.com/error/404?path=cells/python/com.aspose.cells/ShiftType): The shift direction of the columns.
