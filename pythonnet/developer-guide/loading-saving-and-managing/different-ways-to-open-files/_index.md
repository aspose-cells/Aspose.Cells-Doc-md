## **Opening a File via a Path**

Developers can open a Microsoft Excel file using its file path on the local computer by specifying it in the **[Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook)** class constructor. Simply pass the path in the constructor as a *string*. Aspose.Cells will automatically detect the file format type.
