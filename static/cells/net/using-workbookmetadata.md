##Using WorkbookMetadata
Aspose.Cells allows you to load a light-weight version of workbook into memory to edit its metadata information. Please use the [**WorkbookMetadata**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class to load the workbook.
The following sample code uses [**WorkbookMetadata**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class to edit custom document properties of a workbook. Once you open the workbook using [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook) class, you will be able to read the document properties. Here is a sample code using the [**WorkbookMetadata**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class.
