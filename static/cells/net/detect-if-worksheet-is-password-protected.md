##Detect if Worksheet is Password Protected
It is possible to protect the workbooks and worksheets separately. For instance, a spreadsheet may contain one or more worksheets that are password-protected, however, the spreadsheet itself may or may not be protected. Aspose.Cells APIs provide the means to detect if a given worksheet is password protected or not. This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Cells for .NET API to achieve the same.
Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.7.0 has exposed the [**Protection.IsProtectedWithPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/protection/properties/isprotectedwithpassword) property to detect if a worksheet is password protected or not. Boolean type [**Protection.IsProtectedWithPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/protection/properties/isprotectedwithpassword) property returns **true** if [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet) is password-protected and **false** if not.
