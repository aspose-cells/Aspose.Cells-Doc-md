Using Data Bars in conditional formatting is a powerful (and visual!) way to understand your data at a glance.
1. Visual Comparison of Values: Data bars turn numbers into horizontal bars, making it super easy to compare values side by side — like a mini bar chart inside your cells!
1. Immediate Pattern Recognition: You can instantly see highs, lows, and outliers without sorting or scanning numbers.
1. Better Readability: Especially useful in long tables — it reduces cognitive load and helps you grasp key trends quickly.
1. Dynamic & Real-Time: As values change, the bars update automatically — great for tracking live metrics, progress, or KPIs.
1. Professional-Looking Dashboards: Adds a clean, modern, and polished look to reports or dashboards.
