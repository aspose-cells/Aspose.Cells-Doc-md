## **How can I deploy my Aspose.Cells.GridWeb based web project/ solution on the Server?**
If you need to deploy the web application having GridWeb control, you would copy the "acw_client" directory into your project folder least your web application (deployed over the server) could not find it.
You can always specify the scripting path by adding the following lines of code into the configuration section (e.g in the web.config file in your VS.NET Project). The "acw_client" is a folder that contains files and Aspose.Cells.GridWeb uses this folder to manage its internal configuration, it has scripts files, image files and other files to specify GridWeb's behavior and set other operations. The config file is used to prevent the control from using the embedded client resources (images, scripts, etc.) which is useful in some cases / scenarios.
**XML**
The path is always related to the project's directory. You should not use any directory which is outside of the project's directory. So it is necessary to copy the "acw_client" directory (@ your GridWeb installation folder) into the project's directory.
## **Running Aspose.Cell.GridWeb in Internet Explorer **
Currently Aspose.Cells.GridWeb does not support Internet Explorer any more, it is too old browser.
