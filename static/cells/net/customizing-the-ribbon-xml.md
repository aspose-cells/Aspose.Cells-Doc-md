##Customizing the Ribbon XML
Microsoft Office replaced menus and toolbars with a Ribbon at the top of the application window since office 2007. The Ribbon is customizable.
Aspose.Cells allows you to
- Keep Ribbon XML without parsing it,
- Read and write Ribbon XML without parsing it,
- Get and set Ribbon XML data.
If you want to change the Ribbon XML, you have to parse it with an XML parser or other Ribbon XML tool.
