##Verify Password of Encrypted Files
Verify the passord of encrypted Excel (xlsx, xlsb, xls, xlsm) and Open office (ODS) files using CShape codes.
If Excel (xlsx, xlsb, xls, xlsm) and Open office (ODS) files are locked with password, Aspose supports simple password verification without parsing specific data of the files.
## **Verify the password of the encrypted file**
To verify the password of the encrypted file, Aspose.Cells for .NET provides the [**VerifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/fileformatutil/methods/verifypassword) method. These methods accept two parameters, the file stream and the password that needs to be verified.
The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [**VerifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/fileformatutil/methods/verifypassword) method to verify whether the provided password is valid or not.
