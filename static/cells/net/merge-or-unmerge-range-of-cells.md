##Merge or Unmerge Range of Cells
Merge and Unmerge Cells in a Range in Excel with C# code.
You can use Aspose.Cells to merge or split a range of cells. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Range.Merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/methods/merge) and [**Range.UnMerge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/methods/unmerge) methods for this purpose. This article explains how to merge a range of cells into a single cell.
## **Example**
The following sample code first creates a range - A1:D4 - then merges the cells in the range into a single cell using the [**Range.Merge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/methods/merge) method. Similarly, you can split cells by creating a range and calling the [**Range.UnMerge()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/range/methods/unmerge) method.
