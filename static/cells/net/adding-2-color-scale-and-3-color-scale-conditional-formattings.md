How to use the Aspose.Cells library in C# to add conditional formatting for two color ratios and three color ratios. By adjusting these criteria, you have more control over how cells look and appear.

This property is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
