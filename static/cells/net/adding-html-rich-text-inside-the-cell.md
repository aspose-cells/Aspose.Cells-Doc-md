##Adding HTML Rich Text inside the Cell
Learn how to add HTML Rich Text inside the Cell and multiple styles within a single cell through the Aspose.Cells for .NET API.
Aspose.Cells supports converting Microsoft Excel oriented HTML into XLS/XLSX format. It means, the HTML generated by Microsoft Excel can be converted back to XLS/XLSX format using Aspose.Cells.
Similarly, if there is some simple HTML, Aspose.Cells can convert it into HTML Rich Text. Aspose.Cells provides [**Cell.HtmlString**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cell/properties/htmlstring) property which can take such a simple HTML and convert it to formatted cell text.
Below code sample shows you how to add HTML rich text inside the cell. Please see the screenshot of the output Excel file.
