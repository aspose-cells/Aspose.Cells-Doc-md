##Show Formulas Instead of Values in a Worksheet
This article provides sample code for using the C# API or .NET Library to programmatically display formulas rather than values in an Excel worksheet or spreadsheet.
It is possible to show formulas instead of calculated values in Microsoft Excel using the **Show Formulas** option from the **Formulas** ribbon. When formulas are shown, Microsoft Excel displays formulas in the worksheet. You can achieve the same thing using Aspose.Cells.
Aspose.Cells provides a [**Worksheet.ShowFormulas**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/showformulas) property. Set this to **true** to set Microsoft Excel to display formulas.
