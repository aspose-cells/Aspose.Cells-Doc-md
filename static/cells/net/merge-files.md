##Merge Files
## **Introduction**
Aspose.Cells provides different ways for merging files. For simple files with data, formatting, and formulas, the [**Workbook.Combine()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/workbook/methods/combine) method can be used to combine several workbooks, and the [**Worksheet.Copy()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/methods/copy/index) method can be used to copy worksheets into a new workbook. These methods are easy to use and effective, but if you have a lot of files to merge, you might find that they take a lot of system resources. To avoid this, use the [**CellsHelper.MergeFiles**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cellshelper/methods/mergefiles) static method, a more efficient way to merge several files.
## **Merge Files Using Aspose.Cells**
The following sample code illustrates how to merge large files using the [**CellsHelper.MergeFiles**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cellshelper/methods/mergefiles) method. It takes two simple but large files, Book1.xls and Book2.xls. The files contain formatted data and formulas only.
The [**CellsHelper.MergeFiles**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/cellshelper/methods/mergefiles) method only supports merging data, styles, formatting, and formulas. Objects like charts, pictures, comments or other objects might not be merged using this method. Moreover, a cached file is used to store temporary data for the process.
