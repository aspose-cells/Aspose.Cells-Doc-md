##Finding Absolute Position of Shape inside the Worksheet
Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.LeftToCorner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/lefttocorner) and [**Shape.TopToCorner**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/toptocorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of the shape inside the worksheet in pixels.
The following sample code displays the absolute position of the first shape in the worksheet in pixels. The sample code displays the following console output:
