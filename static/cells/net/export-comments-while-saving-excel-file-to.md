##Export Comments while Saving Excel file to HTML
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When you save your Excel file into HTML, comments are not exported. However, Aspose.Cells provides this feature using the [**HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments**](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/net/export-comments-while-saving-excel-file-to/) property. If you set it **true**, then HTML will also display comments present in your Excel file.
