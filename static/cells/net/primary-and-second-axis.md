##Primary and Second Axis
Learn how to understand and work with primary and secondary axes in Aspose.Cells for .NET. Our guide will help you understand the differences between primary and secondary axes, and how to configure and use them effectively in your charts.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When the numbers in a chart vary widely from data series to data series, or when you have mixed types of data (price and volume), plot one or more data series on a secondary vertical (value) axis.  The scale of the secondary vertical axis shows the values for the associated data series.  A secondary axis works well in a chart that shows a combination of column and line charts.
## **Handle Primary and Second Axis like Microsoft Excel**
Please see the following sample code that create a new Excel file and put values of the chart in the first worksheet.
Then we add a chart and show the second-axis.
