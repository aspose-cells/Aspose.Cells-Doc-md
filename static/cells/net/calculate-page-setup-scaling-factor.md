##Calculate Page Setup Scaling Factor
This article provides sample code explaining how to use the C# API or .NET library to calculate Page Setup scaling factor using Fit to n page(s) wide by m tall option of Excel worksheet programmatically.
When you set Page Setup Scaling using **Fit to n page(s) wide by m tall** option, Microsoft Excel calculates the Page Setup Scaling Factor. You can calculate the same thing using [**SheetRender.PageScale**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/properties/pagescale) property. This property returns a double value which can be converted to percentage value. For example, if it returns 0.5 then it means scaling factor is 50%.
The following sample code illustrates how to calculate page setup scaling factor using [**SheetRender.PageScale**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/properties/pagescale) property.
