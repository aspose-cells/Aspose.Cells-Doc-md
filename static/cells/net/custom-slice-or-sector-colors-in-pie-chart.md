##Custom Slice or Sector Colors in Pie Chart
Learn how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to customize slice and sector colors in a pie chart. Our guide will demonstrate how to assign unique colors to each slice, sector, or legion for improved visual appeal and data representation.

1. Access the [**Series**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/series) object's [**ChartPoint**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint).
1. Assign the color of your choice using the [**ChartPoint.Area.ForegroundColor**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/area/properties/foregroundcolor) property.
