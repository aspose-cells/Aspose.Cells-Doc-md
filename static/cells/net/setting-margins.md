The [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet) class provides the [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/pagesetup) property used to set the page setup options for a worksheet. The [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/pagesetup) attribute is an object of the [**PageSetup**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/pagesetup) class that enables developers to set different page layout options for a printed worksheet.
