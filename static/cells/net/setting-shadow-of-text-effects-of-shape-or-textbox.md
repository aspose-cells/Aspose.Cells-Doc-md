##Setting Shadow of Text Effects of Shape or TextBox
You can set the **Shadow** of **Text Effects** of any Shape or TextBox. Please use the [**Shape.TextBody**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/textbody) property. It presents the setting of the shape's text and returns [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects. After accessing it, please set the **Shadow** via [**FontSetting.TextOptions.Shadow.PresetType.PresetType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/properties/presettype) property. This property is of the type [**PresetShadowType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/presetshadowtype) which has several values. Some of these are
- OffsetDiagonalBottomRight
- OffsetBottom
- OffsetDiagonalTopRight
- InsideLeft
- InsideCenter
- PerspectiveDiagonalUpperLeft
- PerspectiveDiagonalLowerRight
The following code snippet demonstrates the use of [**FontSetting.TextOptions.Shadow.PresetType.PresetType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/properties/presettype) property to set shadow of text effects of Shape or TextBox.
