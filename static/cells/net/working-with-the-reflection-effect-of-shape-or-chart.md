## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) property along with [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class to work with the reflection effect of shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.
- [Blur](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/blur)
- [Direction](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/direction)

## **Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart**
The following sample code loads the [source excel file](5115424.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the default worksheet and sets different properties of [Shape.Reflection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) class and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](5115423.xlsx).
