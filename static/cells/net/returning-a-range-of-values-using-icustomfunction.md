##Returning a Range of Values using ICustomFunction
This article describes how to use the Aspose.Cells library to return a range of values with ICustomFunction in Microsoft Excel. By loading an existing Excel file or creating a new Excel file, we can use the methods provided by Aspose.Cells to get a range of values and return the result. Finally, we save the modified Excel file to disk.
The [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction) is deprecated since the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 20.8. Please use the [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/abstractcalculationengine) class. The use of the [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/abstractcalculationengine) class is described in the following article.
[Returning a Range of Values using AbstractCalculationEngine](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/net/returning-a-range-of-values-using-abstractcalculationengine/).
Aspose.Cells provides [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction) interface which is used to implement user-defined or custom functions that are not supported by Microsoft Excel as built-in functions.
Mostly when you implement the [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction) interface method, you need to return a single cell value. But sometimes, you need to return a range of values. This article will explain how to return the range of values from [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction).
The following code implements [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction) and returns the range of values via its method.
Create a class with a function *CalculateCustomFunction*. This class implements [**ICustomFunction**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction).
Now use above function into your program
