##Verify Password Used to Protect the Worksheet
Aspose.Cells APIs have enhanced the [**Protection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Protection) class by introducing some useful properties & methods. One such method is the [**verifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword-java.lang.String-) which allows specifying a password as an instance of String and verifies if the same password has been used to protect the Worksheet.
## **Verify Password Used to Protect the Worksheet**
The [**Protection.verifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword-java.lang.String-) method returns **true** if the specified password matches with the password used to protect the given worksheet, **false** if the specified password does not match. Following piece of code uses the [**Protection.verifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/protection#verifyPassword-java.lang.String-) method in conjunction with [**Protection.isProtectedWithPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/protection#IsProtectedWithPassword) property to detect the password protection, and verifies the password.
