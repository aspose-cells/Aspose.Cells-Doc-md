##Excel to HTML - Use PresentationPreference Option for Better Layout
Aspose.Cells provides a useful property, [**HtmlSaveOptions.PresentationPreference**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#PresentationPreference), that developers can use to get better layout when saving a Microsoft Excel file to HTML or MHT format. The default value of the property is **false**. We recommend setting this property to **true** to get better-looking presentations from an Excel report.
