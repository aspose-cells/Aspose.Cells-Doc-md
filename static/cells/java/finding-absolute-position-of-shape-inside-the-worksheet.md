##Finding Absolute Position of Shape inside the Worksheet
Learn how to Find Absolute Position of Shape inside the Worksheet through the Aspose.Cells for Java APIs.
Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape on a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.getLeftToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#LeftToCorner) and [**Shape.getTopToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#TopToCorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet in pixels.
## **Explanation of the Shape.getLeftToCorner() and Shape.getTopToCorner() properties**
This screenshot explains what distances the [**Shape.getLeftToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#LeftToCorner) and [**Shape.getTopToCorner()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#TopToCorner) properties measure.
