##Find if the cell value starts with single quote mark
Aspose.Cells now provides the [Style.QuotePrefix](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/style#QuotePrefix) property to find if the cell value starts with a single quote mark. Before this property, there was no way to distinguish between strings like sample and 'sample etc.
## **Find if the cell value starts with single quote mark**
The following sample code explains that the strings like sample and 'sample cannot be differentiated with [Cell.StringValue](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell#StringValue) property. Therefore we must use [Style.QuotePrefix](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/style#QuotePrefix) property to distinguish them.
