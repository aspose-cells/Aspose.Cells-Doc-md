### **How to Hide Rows and Columns in PHP**
Developers can hide a row or column by calling the HideRow and HideColumn methods of the Cells collection respectively. Both methods take the row/column index as a parameter to hide the specific row or column.
**PHP Code**
public static function hide_rows_columns($dataDir)
{
# Instantiating a Workbook object by excel file path
$workbook = new Workbook($dataDir . 'Book1.xls');
# Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
$worksheet = $workbook->getWorksheets()->get(0);
$cells = $worksheet->getCells();;
# Hiding the 3rd row of the worksheet
$cells->hideRow(2);
# Hiding the 2nd column of the worksheet
$cells->hideColumn(1);
# Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format
$workbook->save($dataDir . "Hide Rows And Columns.xls");
print "Hide Rows And Columns Successfully." . PHP_EOL;
}
### **How to Show Rows and Columns using PHP**
Developers can unhide any hidden row or column by calling the UnhideRow and UnhideColumn methods of the Cells collection respectively. Both methods take two parameters:
- **Rowor column index** - the index of a row or column that is used to show the specific row or column.
- **Row height or column width** - the row height or column width assigned to the row or column after it's shown.
**PHP Code**
public static function unhide_rows_columns($dataDir)
{
# Instantiating a Workbook object by excel file path
$workbook = new Workbook($dataDir . 'Book1.xls');
# Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
$worksheet = $workbook->getWorksheets()->get(0);
$cells = $worksheet->getCells();;
# Unhiding the 3rd row and setting its height to 13.5
$cells->unhideRow(2,13.5);
# Unhiding the 2nd column and setting its width to 8.5
$cells->unhideColumn(1,8.5);
# Saving the modified Excel file in default (that is Excel 2003) format
$workbook->save($dataDir . "Unhide Rows And Columns.xls");
print "Unhide Rows And Columns Successfully." . PHP_EOL;
}
