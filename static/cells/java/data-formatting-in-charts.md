##Data Formatting in Charts
In our previous topics, we have already provided many examples to demonstrate that how can you set a data source for your chart but in this topic, we are going to provide more details about the types of data that can be set for a chart.
## **Setting Chart Data**
There are two types of data to deal with while working on charts using Aspose.Cells as follows:
- [Chart data](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/data-formatting-in-charts/#chart-data).
- [Category data](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/java/data-formatting-in-charts/#category-data).
### **Chart Data**
Chart data is that data that we use as a data source to build our charts. We can add a range of the cells (containing chart data) by calling the [**SeriesCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/SeriesCollection) object's [**Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/seriescollection#add-java.lang.Object-) method.
### **Category Data**
Category data is used for the labeling of chart data and can be added to [**SeriesCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/SeriesCollection) by using its [**setCategoryData**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/seriescollection#CategoryData) method.
