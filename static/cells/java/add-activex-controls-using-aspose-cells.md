##Add ActiveX Controls using Aspose.Cells
You can add ActiveX controls with Aspose.Cells using the [ShapeCollection.addActiveXControl()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shapecollection#addActiveXControl-int-int-int-int-int-int-int-) method. This method takes a parameter [ControlType](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/ControlType)Â which tells what type of ActiveX control needs to be added inside a worksheet. It has the following values.
- [CHECK_BOX](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#CHECK-BOX)
- [COMBO_BOX](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#COMBO-BOX)
- [COMMAND_BUTTON](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#COMMAND-BUTTON)
- [IMAGE](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#IMAGE)
- [LABEL](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#LABEL)
- [LIST_BOX](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#LIST-BOX)
- [RADIO_BUTTON](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#RADIO-BUTTON)
- [SCROLL_BAR](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#SCROLL-BAR)
- [SPIN_BUTTON](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#SPIN-BUTTON)
- [TEXT_BOX](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#TEXT-BOX)
- [TOGGLE_BUTTON](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#TOGGLE-BUTTON)
- [UNKNOWN](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/controltype#UNKNOWN)
Once, you have added the ActiveX control inside the shape collection, you can then access the ActiveX control object via [Shape.ActiveXControl](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shape#ActiveXControl) property and then set its various properties.
