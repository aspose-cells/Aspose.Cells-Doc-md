##Hiding and Showing Rows and Columns
## **Introduction**
Sometimes, it may also be required by users to hide certain rows or columns of the worksheet and then display them later. Microsoft Excel provides this feature and so as Aspose.Cells.
## **Controlling the Visibility of Rows & Columns**
Aspose.Cells provides a class, [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook), that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The [Workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook) class contains a [WorksheetCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/WorksheetCollection) that allows access to each worksheet in the Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the [Worksheet](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Worksheet) class. The [Worksheet](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Worksheet) class provides a [Cells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Cells) collection that represents all cells in the worksheet. The [Cells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Cells)[ ](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Cells)collection provides several methods for managing rows or columns in a worksheet. Some of these are discussed below.
### **Hiding Rows or Columns**
Developers can hide a row or column by calling the [HideRow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cells#hideRow-int-) and [HideColumn](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cells#hideColumn-int-) methods of the [Cells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Cells) collection respectively. Both methods take the row/column index as a parameter to hide the specific row or column.
Note: It is also possible to hide a row or column if we set the row height or column width to 0 respectively.
### **Showing Rows and Columns**
Developers can unhide any hidden row or column by calling the [UnhideRow](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cells#unhideRow-int-double-) and [UnhideColumn](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cells#unhideColumn-int-double-) methods of the [Cells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Cells) collection respectively. Both methods take two parameters:
- **Row or column index** - the index of a row or column that is used to show the specific row or column.
- **Row height or column width** - the row height or column width assigned to the row or column after it's shown.
While making a hidden column/row visible, if you need to restore it to previously assigned width or height, or its original width or height, please unhide the column or row with negative width or height. For example, worksheet.getCells().unhideColumn(5, -1)
