##Get Worksheet of the Chart
Sometimes, you want to access a worksheet from a chart's reference. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property which returns the reference of the worksheet that contains the chart.
## Example
The following example shows how to use the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property. The code first prints the name of the worksheet, then accesses the first chart on the worksheet. It then prints the worksheet name again, using the [**Chart.getWorksheet()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#Worksheet) property.
### Java code to access the worksheet of the chart
### Console output generated by the sample code
Below is the console output the sample code results in. As you can see, it prints the same worksheet name both times.
Sheet Name: Portfolio
Chart's Sheet Name: Portfolio
