##Export Document Structure While Converting to PDF
PDF logical structure facilities provide a mechanism for incorporating information, regarding the document content structure, into a PDF file. Aspose.Cells preserves information about the structure from a Microsoft Excel document, such as cell, row, table, worksheet, image, shape, header/footer, etc.
With option [PdfSaveOptions.ExportDocumentStructure](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions/#setExportDocumentStructure-boolean-), you can save to a tagged PDF with document structure exported.
