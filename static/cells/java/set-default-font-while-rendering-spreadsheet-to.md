##Set Default Font while rendering spreadsheet to HTML
Aspose.Cells allows you to set default font while rendering spreadsheet to HTML. Please use the [HtmlSaveOptions.DefaultFontName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#DefaultFontName) for this purpose. This property is useful when there are some cells in a spreadsheet that have invalid or non-existing fonts. Then those cells will be rendered in a font specified with [HtmlSaveOptions.DefaultFontName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#DefaultFontName) property.
