##Working with ContentTypeProperties
Aspose.Cells provides [**Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/contenttypepropertycollection#add-java.lang.Object-) method to add custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. You may also make the property optional by setting the [**ContentTypeProperty.IsNillable**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/contenttypeproperty#IsNillable) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
