##Returning a Range of Values using AbstractCalculationEngine
Aspose.Cells provides [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/AbstractCalculationEngine) class which is used to implement user-defined or custom functions that are not supported by Microsoft Excel as built-in functions.
This article will explain how to return the range of values from [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/AbstractCalculationEngine).
The following code demonstrates the use of the [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/AbstractCalculationEngine) and returns the range of values via its method.
Create a class with a function *CalculateCustomFunction*. This class extends [**AbstractCalculationEngine**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/AbstractCalculationEngine).
