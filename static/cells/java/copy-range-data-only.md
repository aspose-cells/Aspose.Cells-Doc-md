##Copy Range Data Only
Sometimes, you need to copy data from one range of cells to another, copying the data only, not the formatting. Aspose.Cells offers this feature by providing the [Range.copyData](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/range#copyData-com.aspose.cells.Range-) method.
## **Copy Range Data Only**
This example shows how to:
1. Create a workbook.
1. Add data to cells in the first worksheet.
1. Create a range.
1. Create a style object with specified formatting attributes.
1. Apply the style formatting to the range.
1. Create another range of cells.
1. Copy data of the first range to this second range by using the [Range.copyData](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/range#copyData-com.aspose.cells.Range-) method.
