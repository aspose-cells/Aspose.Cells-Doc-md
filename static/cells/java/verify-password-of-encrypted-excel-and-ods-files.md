Verify the passord of encrypted Excel (xlsx, xlsb, xls, xlsm) and Open office (ODS) files using Java codes.
If Excel (xlsx, xlsb, xls, xlsm) and Open office (ODS) files are locked with password, Aspose.Cells for Java supports simple password verification without parsing specific data of the files.
## **Verify the password of the encrypted file**
To verify the password of the encrypted file, Aspose.Cells for Java provides the [**VerifyPassword**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/fileformatutil#verifyPassword-java.io.InputStream-java.lang.String-) method. The methods accepts two parameters, the file stream and the password that needs to be verified.
