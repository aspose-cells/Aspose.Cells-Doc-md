##Read and Write to Excel With Kotlin
Learn to read, write, and format Excel files in Kotlin using Aspose.Cells for Java. Includes code examples for formulas and formatting.
Aspose.Cells for Java is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate Excel files programmatically. While it is designed for Java, it integrates seamlessly with Kotlin, thanks to Kotlin's full interoperability with Java. This document provides a step-by-step guide to reading from and writing to Excel files using Kotlin and Aspose.Cells for Java.
## Prerequisites
- Kotlin and Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A build tool (Maven or Gradle) configured for dependency management.
## Setting Up Aspose.Cells in a Kotlin Project
Add the Aspose.Cells dependency to your project:
### For Maven (`pom.xml`):
```xml
```
### For Gradle (`build.gradle.kts`):
```kotlin
repositories {
maven { url = uri("https://releases.aspose.com/java/repo/") }
}
dependencies {
// Aspose.Cells for Java
implementation("com.aspose:aspose-cells:25.2")
// Mandatory Bouncy Castle Libraries
implementation("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.68")
implementation("org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:1.68")
}
```
## Write to Excel
This example demonstrates how to create a new Excel workbook, populate cells with data, and save the file to disk.
## Read from Excel
This example shows how to load an existing Excel file, read cell values, and print the results.
## Advanced Operations
### Handle Formulas
This example adds a formula (`SUM`) to a cell, recalculates the workbook, and prints the result.
### Format Cells
This example applies styling (bold text, red color, and center alignment) to a cell.
