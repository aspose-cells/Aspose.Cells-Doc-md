##Line Breaks and Text Wrapping
To ensure that text in a cell can be read, explicit line breaks and text wrapping can be applied. Text wrapping turns one line into several in a cell, which explicit line breaks put in breaks exactly where you want them.
## **To Wrap Text in a Cell**
To wrap text in a cell, use the [**Aspose.Cells.Style.setTextWrapped**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/style#IsTextWrapped) property.
