##Combine Multiple Workbooks into a Single Workbook
Combine multiple workbooks into single workbooks by using Java code and Aspose.Cells for Java API.
Sometimes, you need to combine workbooks with various content like images, charts, and data into a single workbook. Aspose.Cells supports this feature. This article shows how to create a simple application to combine workbooks with a few, simple lines of code using Aspose.Cells.
## **Combining Workbooks**
The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells for Java. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [**Workbook.combine()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#combine-com.aspose.cells.Workbook-)Â method to combine them and saves the output workbook.
### **Source Workbooks**
- [charts.xlsx](5473097.xlsx)
- [picture.xlsx](5473096.xlsx)
### **Output Workbooks**
- [combined.xlsx](5473095.xlsx)
### **Screenshots**
Below are screenshots of the source and output workbooks.
You can use any source workbooks. These images are just for illustration purposes.
