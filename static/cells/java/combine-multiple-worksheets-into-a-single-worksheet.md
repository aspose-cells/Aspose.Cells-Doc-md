##Merge Multiple Worksheets into a Single Worksheet
Combine multiple worksheets into single worksheet by using Java code and Aspose.Cells for Java API.
Sometimes, you need to combine multiple worksheets into a single worksheet. This can easily be achieved using Aspose.Cells API. This article will show you a code example that reads a source workbook and combines the data of all source worksheets into a single worksheet inside a destination workbook.
## **How to Combine Worksheets**
The sample below uses the [**Range.copy()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/range#copy-com.aspose.cells.Range-)Â method to copy all source worksheets into a single sheet inside a destination workbook.
### **Source Workbook**
You can use any source workbook. For this example, we are using a source workbook which has three worksheets.
