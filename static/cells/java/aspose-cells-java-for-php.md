## **Introduction to Aspose.Cells Java for PHP**
### **PHP / Java Bridge**
The PHP/Java Bridge is an implementation of a streaming, XML-based [network protocol](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/PROTOCOL.TXT), which can be used to connect a native script engine, for example PHP, Scheme or Python, with a Java virtual machine. It is up to 50 times faster than local RPC via SOAP, requires less resources on the web-server side. It is [faster](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/FAQ.html#performance) and more reliable than direct communication via the Java Native Interface, and it requires no additional components to invoke Java procedures from PHP or PHP procedures from Java.

## **Downloads and Configure**
### **Download Required Libraries**
Download required libraries mentioned below. These are the required for executing Aspose.Cells Java for PHP examples.
- **Aspose:** [Aspose.Cells for Java Component](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/java)
- [PHP/Java Bridge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_7.2.1/php-java-bridge_7.2.1_documentation.zip/download)
### **Download Examples from Social Coding Sites**
Following releases of running examples are available to download on below mentioned social coding sites:
#### **GitHub**
- **Aspose.Cells Java for PHP Examples**
- [Aspose.Cells Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Cells_Java_for_PHP)
### **How to configure the source code on Linux Platform**
Please follow these simple steps in order to open and extend the source code while using:
#### **1. Install Tomcat Server**
To install tomcat server, issue following command on the linux console. This will successfully install tomcat server.
sudo apt-get install tomcat8
#### **2. Download and Configure PHP/JavaBridge**
In order to download the PHP/JavaBridge binaries, issue following command on the linux console.
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_7.2.1/php-java-bridge_7.2.1_documentation.zip/download
Unzip the PHP/JavaBridge binaries by issuing the following command on linux console.
unzip -d php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip
This will extract **JavaBridge.war** file. Copy it to tomcat88 **webapps** folder by issuing the following command on Linux console.
sudo cp JavaBridge.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/JavaBridge.war
By copying, tomcat8 will automatically create a new folder "**JavaBridge**" in **webapps**. Once the folder is created, make sure your tomcat8 is running and then check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** in browser, it should open a default page of JavaBridge.
If any error message appears then install  **FastCGI** by issuing the following command on Linux console.
sudo apt-get install php55-cgi
After installing php5.5 cgi, restart tomcat8 server and check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** again in the browser.
If **JAVA_HOME** error is displayed, then open /etc/default/tomcat8 file and uncomment the line that sets the JAVA_HOME. Check **localhost:8080/JavaBridge** in browser again, it should come with PHP/JavaBridge Examples page.
#### **3. Configure Aspose.Cells Java for PHP Examples**
Clone, PHP examples by issuing the following commands inside webapps/JavaBridge folder.
$ git init&nbsp;
$ git clone [https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Cells_Java_for_PHP]
### **How to configure the source code on Windows Platform**
Please follow below simple steps to configure PHP/Java Bridge on Windows Platform
\1. Install PHP5 and configure as you normally do
\2. Install JRE 6 (Java Runtime Environment) if you don’t already have it. You can check this in C:\Program Files etc. You can download it here . I am using JRE 6 as It is compatible with PHP Java Bridge (PJB).
\3. Install Apache Tomcat 8.0. You can download it here
4.Download [JavaBridge.war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/JavaBridgeTemplate621.war/download). Copy this file to tomcat webapps directory.
(ex: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps )
\5. Restart tomcat apache service.
6.Go to **localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php** to check if php works. You can find other examples in there
7.Copy your [Aspose.Cells Java](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/java) jar file to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\WEB-INF\lib
\8. Clone [Aspose.Cells Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Cells_Java_for_PHP) examples inside C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\ folder.
\8. Copy folder C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\java to your Aspose.Cells Java for PHP examples folder.
\10. Restart apache tomcat service and start using examples.
