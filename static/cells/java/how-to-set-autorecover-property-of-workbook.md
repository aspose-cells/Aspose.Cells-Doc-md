##How to set AutoRecover property of Workbook
You can use Aspose.Cells to set AutoRecover property of workbook. The default value of this property is **true**. When you set it **false** on a workbook, Microsoft Excel disables Autorecover (Autosave) on that Excel file.
Aspose.Cells provides [**Workbook.getSettings().setAutoRecover()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbooksettings#AutoRecover) property to enable or disable this option.
