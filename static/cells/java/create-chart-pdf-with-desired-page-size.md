## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
You can create a chart PDF with your desired page size using Aspose.Cells and specify how you want to align the chart inside the page. You may align the chart to the top, bottom, center, left, right, etc. Besides, the output chart can be created in a stream or on disk.
## **Create Chart PDF with Desired Page Size**
Please see the following sample code that loads the [sample Excel file](64716912.xlsx), accesses the first chart inside the worksheet and then converts it into [output PDF](64716911.pdf) with desired page size.
