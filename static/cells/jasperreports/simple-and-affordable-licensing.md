##Simple and Affordable Licensing
Every Aspose license comes with 1-year worth of [free upgrades](https://purchase.aspose.com/policies/subscriptions) to any new version of the product that comes out and unlimited free technical support.
Aspose.Cells for JasperReports evaluation and paid versions are the same download. Simply [download Aspose.Cells for JasperReports](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/jasperreports) and [install it](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/jasperreports/installation/). By default, the exporter works in evaluation mode. Evaluation mode injects watermarks into exported reports. To remove the watermark, [purchase a license](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) and follow the instructions on [how to apply the license](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/jasperreports/licensing/).
Make sure to take advantage of the Aspose.Cells for JasperReports evaluation as it does not have a time limit and comes with free technical support.
