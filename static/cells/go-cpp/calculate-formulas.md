##Calculate Formulas with Golang via C++
This article introduces how to use Aspose.Cells library to calculate formulas in Microsoft Excel with Golang via C++. By loading an existing Excel file or creating a new Excel file, we can use the methods provided by Aspose.Cells to calculate the formula and get the result. Finally, we save the modified Excel file to disk.
## **Adding Formulas & Calculating Results**
Aspose.Cells has an embedded formula calculation engine. Not only can it re-calculate formulas imported from designer templates, but it also supports calculating the results of formulas added at runtime.
Aspose.Cells supports most of the formulas or functions that are part of Microsoft Excel (Read [a list of the functions supported by the calculation engine](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/cpp/supported-formula-functions/)). Those functions can be used through the APIs or designer spreadsheets. Aspose.Cells supports a huge set of mathematical, string, boolean, date/time, statistical, database, lookup, and reference formulas.
Use the [**GetFormula**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getformula/) property or [**SetFormula(...)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setformula/) methods of the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/) class to add a formula to a cell. When applying a formula, always begin the string with an equal sign (=) as you do when creating a formula in Microsoft Excel and use a comma (,) to delimit function parameters.
To calculate the results of formulas, the user may call the [**CalculateFormula**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbook/calculateformula/) method of the [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/) class, which processes all formulas embedded in an Excel file. Or, the user may call the [**CalculateFormula**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/calculateformula/) method of the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/) class, which processes all formulas embedded in a sheet. Or, the user may also call the [**Calculate**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/calculate/) method of the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/) class, which processes the formula of one Cell:
### **Important to Know for Formulas**
The **GetFormula** property and **SetFormula(...)** methods of the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/) class work differently from the **Calculate** methods of the [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/), [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/), and [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/) classes. The **GetFormula** property and **SetFormula(...)** methods simply add the formula to a cell but do not calculate the result at runtime. To get the result of the formulas, please call the **Calculate** methods.
## **Direct Calculation of Formula**
Aspose.Cells has an embedded formula calculation engine. As well as calculating formulas imported from a designer file, Aspose.Cells can calculate formula results directly.
Sometimes, you need to calculate formula results directly without adding them into a worksheet. The values of the cells used in the formula already exist in a worksheet, and all you need is to find the result of those values based on some Microsoft Excel formula without adding the formula in a worksheet.
You can use Aspose.Cells' formula calculation engine APIs for [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheet/) to [**calculate**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/worksheet/calculateformula/) the results of such formulas without adding them to the worksheet:
Above code produces the following output:
Value of A1: 20
Value of A2: 30
Result of Sum(A1:A2): 50.0
## **How to Calculate Formulas Repeatedly**
When there are lots of formulas in the workbook and the user needs to calculate them repeatedly with modifying only a small part of them, it may be helpful for performance to enable the formula calculation chain: [**FormulaSettings.GetEnableCalculationChain()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/formulasettings/getenablecalculationchain/).
### **Important to Know**
By default, the calculation chain is disabled. Because creating the chain also needs extra time, the first time of calculating formulas ([**Workbook.CalculateFormula(...)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/workbook/calculateformula/)) may consume more CPU processing time and memory when comparing with calculating formulas without a chain. If the user does not need to calculate formulas repeatedly, the default behavior (calculating formula directly without creating a calculation chain) should be the better way.
