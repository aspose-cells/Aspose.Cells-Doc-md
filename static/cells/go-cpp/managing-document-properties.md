## **Managing Document Properties**
The following sample code loads [sample Excel file](23166989.xlsx) and reads the built-in document properties, e.g., *Title and Subject*, and then changes them. Then, it also reads the custom document property, i.e., *MyCustom1* and then adds a new custom document property, i.e., *MyCustom5* and writes the [output Excel file](23166986.xlsx). The following screenshot shows the effect of the sample code on the sample Excel file.
