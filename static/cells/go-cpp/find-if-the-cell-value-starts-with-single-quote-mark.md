##Find if the cell value starts with single quote mark with Golang via C++
Learn how to find if the cell value starts with a single quote mark through the Aspose.Cells for C++ API.
Aspose.Cells now provides the [**Style::QuotePrefix**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/style/getquoteprefix/) property to find if the cell value starts with a single quote mark. Before this property, there was no way to distinguish between strings like sample and 'sample etc.
The following sample code explains that the strings like sample and 'sample cannot be differentiated with [**Cell::GetStringValue**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getstringvalue_cellvalueformatstrategy/) property. Therefore we must use [**Style::QuotePrefix**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/style/getquoteprefix/) property to distinguish them.
