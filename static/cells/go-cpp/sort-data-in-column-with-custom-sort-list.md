##Sort Data in Column with Custom Sort List with Golang via C++
Learn how to sort data in the column using a custom list by using the Aspose.Cells for C++ API.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
You can sort data in the column using a custom list. This can be done using [**DataSorter::AddKey(int key, SortOrder order, String customList)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/datasorter/addkey_int_sortorder/) method. However, this method works only if the items in the custom list do not have commas inside them. If they have commas like "USA,US", "China,CN" etc., then you must use [**DataSorter::AddKey Method (Int32, SortOrder, String[])**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/datasorter/addkey_int_sortorder/) method. Here, the last parameter is not String but an Array of Strings.
## **Sort Data in Column with Custom Sort List**
The following sample code explains how to use [**DataSorter::AddKey Method (Int32, SortOrder, String[])**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/datasorter/addkey_int_sortorder/) method to sort data with custom sort list. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528327.xlsx) used in this code and [output Excel file](50528328.xlsx) generated by it. The following screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file on execution.
