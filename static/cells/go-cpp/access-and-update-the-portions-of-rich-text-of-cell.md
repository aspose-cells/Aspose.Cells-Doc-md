##Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell with Golang via C++
Learn how to Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell through the Aspose.Cells for C++ API.
Aspose.Cells allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of the cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell->GetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getcharacters/) and [**Cell->SetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setcharacters/) methods. These methods will return and accept the array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/fontsetting/) objects which you can use to access and update various properties of font like font name, font color, boldness, etc.
## **Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell**
The following code demonstrates the usage of [**Cell->GetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/go-cpp/cell/getcharacters/) and [**Cell->SetCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/cell/setcharacters/) method using the [source excel file](5112369.xlsx). The source excel file has a rich text in cell A1 with 3 portions, each having a different font. The code accesses these portions and updates the first portion's font to **"Arial"**. The modified workbook is saved as [output excel file](5112366.xlsx).
