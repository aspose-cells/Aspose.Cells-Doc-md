##Aspose.Cells for JasperReports
**Welcome to Aspose.Cells for JasperReports**
Aspose.Cells for JasperReports is a library which works as a replacement for [JasperReports](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library)'s original Microsoft Excel exporter, bundled with some great enhancements. It eliminates the dependency on the POI library, and uses Aspose.Cells for Java on the back-end to export reports in Microsoft Excel formats (XLS, XLSX).
