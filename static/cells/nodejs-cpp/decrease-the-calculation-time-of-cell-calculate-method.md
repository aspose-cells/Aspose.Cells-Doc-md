##Decrease the Calculation Time of Cell.Calculate method with Node.js via C++
This article introduces how to use the Aspose.Cells library to reduce calculation time for cell calculation methods in Excel using Node.js via C++.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Normally, we recommend users to call [**Workbook.calculateFormula()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/workbook/#calculateFormula--) method once and then get the calculated values of the individual cells. But sometimes, users do not want to calculate the entire workbook. They just want to calculate a single cell. Aspose.Cells provides [**CalculationOptions.getRecursive()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/calculationoptions/#getRecursive--) property, which you can set to **false** to decrease the calculation time of individual cells significantly. When the recursive property is set to **true**, then all the dependents of cells are recalculated on each call. However, when the recursive property is **false**, then dependent cells are calculated only once and are not recalculated on subsequent calls.
## **Decrease the Calculation Time of Cell.calculate() method**
The following sample code illustrates the usage of [**CalculationOptions.getRecursive()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/calculationoptions/#getRecursive--) property. Please execute this code with the given [sample excel file](5113710.xlsx) and check its console output. You will find that setting the recursive property to **false** has significantly decreased the calculation time. Please also read the comments for a better understanding of this property.
```javascript
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");
const path = require("path");
// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
const filePath = path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx");
// Loads the workbook which contains hidden external links
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(filePath);
// Test calculation time after setting recursive true
workbook.calculateFormula(); // Call calculateFormula method to initiate calculation
// Test calculation time after setting recursive false
workbook.calculateFormula(false); // Specify ignoreError as false
```
```javascript
const AsposeCells = require("aspose.cells.node");
const path = require("path");
function testCalcTimeRecursive(rec) {
// The path to the documents directory.
const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, "data");
// Load your sample workbook
const workbook = new AsposeCells.Workbook(path.join(dataDir, "sample.xlsx"));
// Access first worksheet
const ws = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
// Set the calculation option, set recursive true or false as per parameter
const opts = new AsposeCells.CalculationOptions();
opts.setRecursive(rec);
// Start stop watch
const start = process.hrtime();
// Calculate cell A1 one million times
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
ws.getCells().get("A1").calculate(opts);
}
// Stop the watch
const end = process.hrtime(start);
// Calculate elapsed time in seconds
const estimatedTime = end[0] + end[1] / 1e9;
// Print the elapsed time in seconds
console.log(`Recursive ${rec}: ${estimatedTime} seconds`);
}
// Call the function for testing
testCalcTimeRecursive(true);
testCalcTimeRecursive(false);
```
## **Console Output**
This is the console output of the above sample code when executed with the given [sample excel file](5113710.xlsx) on our machine. Please note, your output may differ, but the elapsed time after setting the recursive property to **false** will always be less than setting it to **true**.
Recursive True: 96 seconds
Recursive False: 42 seconds
