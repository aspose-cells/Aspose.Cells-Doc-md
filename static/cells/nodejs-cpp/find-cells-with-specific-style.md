Learn how to find or search cells with a particular style applied through the Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ API.
Sometimes, you need to find cells with a particular style applied. You can use Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ to find all cells with a common style. Aspose.Cells provides the [**FindOptions.setStyle(Style)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/findoptions/#setStyle-style-) method which you can use to specify the style to search cells for.
