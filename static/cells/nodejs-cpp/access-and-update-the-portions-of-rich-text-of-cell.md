##Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell
Learn how to Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell through the Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ API.
Aspose.Cells for Node.js via C++ allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of the cell. For this purpose, you can use [**Cell.getCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cell/#getCharacters--) and [**Cell.setCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cell/#setCharacters-fontsettingarray-) methods. These methods will return and accept the array of [**FontSetting**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/fontsetting) objects which you can use to access and update various properties of font like font name, font color, boldness, etc.
## **Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell**
The following code demonstrates the usage of [**Cell.getCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cell/#getCharacters--) and [**Cell.setCharacters()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/cell/#setCharacters-fontsettingarray-) method using the [source excel file](5112369.xlsx) which you can download from the provided link. The source excel file has a rich text in the cell A1. It has 3 portions and each portion has a different font.
