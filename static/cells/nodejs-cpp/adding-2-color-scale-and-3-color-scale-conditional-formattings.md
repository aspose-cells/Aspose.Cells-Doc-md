##Adding 2-Color Scale and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings
How to use the Aspose.Cells library in Node.js via C++ to add conditional formatting for two color ratios and three color ratios. By adjusting these criteria, you have more control over how cells look and appear.
**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they are differed by [**ColorScale.setIs3ColorScale(boolean)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/nodejs-cpp/colorscale/#setIs3ColorScale-boolean-) method. This method is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
The following sample code adds 2-Color and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings. It generates the [output excel file](5115058.xlsx).
