##Extracting OLE Objects from Worksheet
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells allows you to extract all types of OLE objects from the worksheet. Please use [Worksheet->GetOleObjects()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheet/getoleobjects/) method to access all the OLE objects inside the worksheet. Each OLE object has [ProgID](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobject/getprogid/) and [ObjectData](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/oleobject/getobjectdata/) properties that can help you identify the type of OLE object and extract it successfully.
