##Convert Workbook to JSON with C++
Learn how to convert Excel workbooks to JSON format using Aspose.Cells for C++.
Aspose.Cells supports converting a workbook to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file.
## **Convert Excel Workbook to JSON**
The Aspose.Cells API provides support for converting spreadsheets to JSON format. To export the workbook to JSON, pass [**SaveFormat::Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/saveformat/) as the second parameter of the [**Workbook::Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/workbook/save/) method. You may also use the [**JsonSaveOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/jsonsaveoptions/) class to specify additional settings for exporting the worksheet to JSON.
The following code example demonstrates exporting the active worksheet to JSON by using the [**SaveFormat::Json**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/saveformat/) enumeration member. Please see the code to convert [source file](book1.xlsx) to the [output JSON file](book1.json) generated by the code for reference.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Path of input excel file
U16String inputFilePath = srcDir + u"Book1.xlsx";
// Create workbook
Workbook workbook(inputFilePath);
// Save the workbook as JSON
U16String outputFilePath = srcDir + u"book1.json";
workbook.Save(outputFilePath);
std::cout << "Workbook converted to JSON successfully!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
