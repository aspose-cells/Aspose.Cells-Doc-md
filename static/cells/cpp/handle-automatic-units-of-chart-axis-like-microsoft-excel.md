##Handle Automatic Units of Chart Axis like Microsoft Excel with C++
Learn how to handle automatic units on chart axes in Aspose.Cells for C++, similar to Microsoft Excel. Our guide will show you how to configure and customize automatic units on a chart axis, including the display of scientific notation and adjusting the scale.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Early versions of Aspose.Cells were not able to handle automatic units of the chart axis properly when the chart is rendered to image or PDF. Now, Aspose.Cells supports the handling of automatic units of the chart axis. There is no code change. Just convert your chart into image or PDF and it will render the chart axis just like Microsoft Excel renders it.
## **Handle Automatic Units of Chart Axis like Microsoft Excel**
The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](61767755.xlsx) and generates the [output PDF chart](61767752.pdf). The screenshot shows the automatic units of chart axis in red rectangles andÂ also compares the sample Excel file chart with the output PDF chart. Both are exactly similar.

## **Sample Code**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Output directory path
U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");
// Load the sample Excel file
U16String inputFilePath = srcDir + u"sampleHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.xlsx";
Workbook wb(inputFilePath);
// Access first worksheet
WorksheetCollection worksheets = wb.GetWorksheets();
Worksheet ws = worksheets.Get(0);
// Access first chart
ChartCollection charts = ws.GetCharts();
Chart ch = charts.Get(0);
// Render chart to PDF
U16String outputFilePath = outDir + u"outputHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.pdf";
ch.ToPdf(outputFilePath);
std::cout << "Chart rendered to PDF successfully!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
