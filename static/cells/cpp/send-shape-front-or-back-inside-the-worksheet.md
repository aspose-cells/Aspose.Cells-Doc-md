##Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet with C++
Learn how to change the z-order position of shapes in a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for C++.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When there are multiple shapes present in the same location, their visibility is determined by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells provides the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/tofrontorback/) method, which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send a shape to the back, you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. If you want to bring a shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.
## **Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**
The following sample code demonstrates the usage of the [**Shape.ToFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/tofrontorback/) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](50528330.xlsx) used in the code and the [output Excel file](50528331.xlsx) generated by it. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the sample Excel file upon execution.

## **Sample Code**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Output directory path
U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");
// Load source Excel file
Workbook wb(srcDir + u"sampleToFrontOrBack.xlsx");
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.GetWorksheets().Get(0);
// Access first and fourth shape
Shape sh1 = ws.GetShapes().Get(0);
Shape sh4 = ws.GetShapes().Get(3);
// Print the Z-Order position of the shape
std::cout << "Z-Order Shape 1: " << sh1.GetZOrderPosition() << std::endl;
// Send this shape to front
sh1.ToFrontOrBack(2);
// Print the Z-Order position of the shape
std::cout << "Z-Order Shape 4: " << sh4.GetZOrderPosition() << std::endl;
// Send this shape to back
sh4.ToFrontOrBack(-2);
// Save the output Excel file
wb.Save(outDir + u"outputToFrontOrBack.xlsx");
std::cout << "Shapes reordered successfully!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
