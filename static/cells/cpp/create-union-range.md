##Create Union Range with C++
Create Union Range in Excel files using Aspose.Cells with C++.
## **Create Union Range**
Aspose.Cells provides the ability to create Union Range by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method accepts two parameters, the address to create the union range and the index of the worksheet. The [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method returns a [UnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/unionrange/) object.
The following code snippet demonstrates creating a Union Range by using the [CreateUnionRange](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/worksheetcollection/createunionrange/) method. The output file generated by the code is attached for reference.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Create a Workbook object
Workbook workbook;
// Create union range
UnionRange unionRange = workbook.GetWorksheets().CreateUnionRange(u"sheet1!A1:A10,sheet1!C1:C10", 0);
// Put value "ABCD" in the range
unionRange.SetValue(u"ABCD");
// Save the output workbook
workbook.Save(u"CreateUnionRange_out.xlsx");
std::cout << "Union range created and workbook saved successfully!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
