##Use Custom XML Parts in Aspose.Cells with C++
Learn how to use custom XML parts in Excel files programmatically using Aspose.Cells with C++.
## Using Custom XML Parts in Aspose.Cells
Custom XML Parts are XML data stored by different applications like SharePoint inside an Excel file. This data is consumed by various applications that require it. Microsoft Excel does not use this data, so there is no GUI to add it. You can view this data by changing the extension of **.xlsx** to **.zip** and then opening it using **WinZip**. You can also open the ZIP file using any third-party Windows zip utility such as WinRAR or WinZip. The data is present inside the **customXml** folder.
You can add custom XML parts using Aspose.Cells via the [**Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypepropertycollection/add/) method.
The following sample code uses the [**Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypepropertycollection/add/) method to add the **Book Catalog XML**, and its name is **BookStore**. The following image shows the result of this code. As you can see, the Book Catalog XML is added inside the BookStore node, which is the name of this property.

## C++ Code to Use Custom XML Parts
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Output directory path
U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");
// The sample XML that will be injected to Workbook
U16String booksXML = uR"(<catalog>
// Create an instance of Workbook class
Workbook workbook;
// Add Custom XML Part to ContentTypePropertyCollection
workbook.GetContentTypeProperties().Add(u"BookStore", booksXML);
// Save the resultant spreadsheet
workbook.Save(outDir + u"output.xlsx");
std::cout << "Custom XML part added and workbook saved successfully!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
