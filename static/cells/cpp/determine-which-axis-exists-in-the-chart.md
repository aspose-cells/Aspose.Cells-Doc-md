##Determine which Axis exists in the Chart with C++
Learn how to determine which axis exists in a chart created using Aspose.Cells for C++. Our guide will help you understand how to identify and access the different axes in a chart, including category, value, and secondary axes.
Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the Chart. For example, he wants to know if a Secondary Value Axis exists inside the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have an axis.
Aspose.Cells provides [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/hasaxis/) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.
The following sample code demonstrates the use of [**Chart.HasAxis(AxisType axisType, bool isPrimary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells.charts/chart/hasaxis/) to determine if the sample chart has Primary and Secondary Category and Value Axis.
## C++ code to determine which axis exists in the chart
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C
// Create source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Create a workbook object
Workbook workbook(srcDir + u"source.xlsx");
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);
// Access the chart
Chart chart = worksheet.GetCharts().Get(0);
// Determine which axis exists in the chart
bool ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Category, true);
std::wcout << u"Has Primary Category Axis: " << ret << std::endl;
ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Category, false);
std::wcout << u"Has Secondary Category Axis: " << ret << std::endl;
ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Value, true);
std::wcout << u"Has Primary Value Axis: " << ret << std::endl;
ret = chart.HasAxis(AxisType::Value, false);
std::wcout << u"Has Secondary Value Axis: " << ret << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
## Console output generated by the sample code
The console output of the code has been shown below which displays true for Primary Category and Value Axis and false for Secondary Category and Value Axis.
Has Primary Category Axis: True
Has Secondary Category Axis: False
Has Primary Value Axis: True
Has Secondary Value Axis: False
