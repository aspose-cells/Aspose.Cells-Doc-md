##Search Data using Original Values with C++
Learn how to Search Data using Original Values through the Aspose.Cells for C++ API.
Sometimes the value of the data is hidden because it is formatted in some way. For example, suppose cell D4 has formula =Sum(A1:A2) and its value is 20 but it is formatted as ---, then the value 20 is hidden and cannot be found using Microsoft Excel find options. However, you can find it using Aspose.Cells using [**LookInType.OriginalValues**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/lookintype/)
The following sample code illustrates the above point. It finds cell D4 which cannot be found using Microsoft Excel find options but Aspose.Cells can find it using [**LookInType.OriginalValues**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/lookintype/). Please read the comments inside the code for more information.
## C++ code to search data using original values
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Output directory path
U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");
// Create workbook object
Workbook workbook;
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);
// Add 10 in cell A1 and A2
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A1").PutValue(10);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A2").PutValue(10);
// Add Sum formula in cell D4 but customize it as ---
Cell cell = worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"D4");
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.SetCustom(u"---", true);
cell.SetStyle(style);
// The result of formula will be 20 but 20 will not be visible because the cell is formatted as ---
cell.SetFormula(u"=Sum(A1:A2)");
// Calculate the workbook
workbook.CalculateFormula();
// Create find options, we will search 20 using original values otherwise 20 will never be found because it is formatted as ---
FindOptions options;
options.SetLookInType(LookInType::OriginalValues);
options.SetLookAtType(LookAtType::EntireContent);
Cell foundCell;
int32_t obj = 20;
// Find 20 which is Sum(A1:A2) and formatted as ---
foundCell = worksheet.GetCells().Find(obj, foundCell, options);
// Print the found cell
std::cout << foundCell.ToString().ToUtf8() << std::endl;
// Save the workbook
workbook.Save(outDir + u"output_out.xlsx");
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
## Console output generated by the sample code
Here is the console output of the above sample code.
Aspose.Cells.Cell [ D4; ValueType : IsNumeric; Value : ---; Formula:=SUM(A1:A2)]
