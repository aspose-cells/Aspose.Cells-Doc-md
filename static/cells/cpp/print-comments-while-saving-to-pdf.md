Learn how to print comments while saving Excel files to PDF using Aspose.Cells for C++.
Microsoft Excel allows you to print comments while printing or saving to PDF format with the following options:
- None
- At end of sheet
- As displayed on sheet
Aspose.Cells provides the [**PrintCommentsType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/printcommentstype/) enum to support the same feature. The [**PrintCommentsType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/printcommentstype/) enum has the following members:
- PrintNoComments
- PrintInPlace
- PrintSheetEnd
## **Print Comments while saving to PDF**
The following sample code illustrates how to use [**PrintCommentsType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/cpp/aspose.cells/printcommentstype/) to print comments while saving to PDF.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Aspose.Cells.h"
using namespace Aspose::Cells;
int main()
{
Aspose::Cells::Startup();
// Source directory path
U16String srcDir(u"..\\Data\\01_SourceDirectory\\");
// Output directory path
U16String outDir(u"..\\Data\\02_OutputDirectory\\");
// Path of input excel file
U16String inputFilePath = srcDir + u"SampleWorkbookWithComments.xlsx";
// Path of output pdf file
U16String outputFilePath = outDir + u"PrintCommentWhileSavingToPdf_out.pdf";
// Create a workbook from source Excel file
Workbook workbook(inputFilePath);
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);
/*
* For print no comments use "PrintCommentsType::PrintNoComments"
* and for print the comments as displayed on sheet use "PrintCommentsType::PrintInPlace"
* For Print the comments at the end of sheet we use "PrintCommentsType::PrintSheetEnd"
*/
worksheet.GetPageSetup().SetPrintComments(PrintCommentsType::PrintSheetEnd);
// Save workbook in pdf format
workbook.Save(outputFilePath, SaveFormat::Pdf);
std::cout << "Workbook saved successfully with comments printed at the end of the sheet!" << std::endl;
Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();
}
```
