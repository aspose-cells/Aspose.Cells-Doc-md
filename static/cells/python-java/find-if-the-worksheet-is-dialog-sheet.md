Aspose.Cells for Python via Java provides you with the ability to check if the worksheet is a dialog sheet. For this, it provides the [Worksheet.Type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/worksheet#Type) property. If [Worksheet.Type](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/worksheet#Type) returns enumeration value [SheetType.DIALOG](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python/asposecells.api/sheettype#DIALOG), then it means, you are dealing with a dialog sheet.
The following code snippet shows how to check for a dialog sheet. The console output generated by the code is given below for reference.
