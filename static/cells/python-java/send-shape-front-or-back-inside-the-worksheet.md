##Bring shapes to the front or back in a worksheet
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When there are multiple shapes present in the same location then how will they be visible is decided by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells provides [**Shape.toFrontOrBack()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/shape#toFrontOrBack(int)) method which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send shape to back you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. and if you want to send shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.
## **Bring Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet**
