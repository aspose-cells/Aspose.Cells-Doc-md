How to  Save ODS File in ODF 1.1 and 1.2 Specifications with Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API.
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET supports saving an ODS file (**OpenDocument Spreadsheet**) in the ODF (**OpenDocument Format**) 1.1 and 1.2 specifications. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET has [**OdsSaveOptions.is_strict_schema11**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/odssaveoptions/is_strict_schema11/) property that specifies the use of ODF 1.1 specification for saving ODS files. The default value of this property is **false**, so the ODS file saved without this setting uses the 1.2 specifications.
