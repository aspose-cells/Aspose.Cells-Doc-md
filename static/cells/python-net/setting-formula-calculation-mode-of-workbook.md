##Setting Formula Calculation Mode of Workbook with Python.NET
Learn how to set formula calculation mode (automatic, manual) in Excel workbooks using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API. Step-by-step guide with code examples.
## **Setting Formula Calculation Mode in Workbook**
Microsoft Excel provides three formula calculation modes:
- **Automatic**: Recalculates formulas on every change and workbook open
- **Automatic except for data tables**: Recalculates formulas except data tables on changes
- **Manual**: Only recalculates when user requests (F9/CTRL+ALT+F9) or during save
### **Setting Calculation Mode with Aspose.Cells**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**formula_settings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/formulasettings/) configuration through the [**Workbook.settings**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/settings/) property. Use the [**calculation_mode**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/formulasettings/calculation_mode/) attribute to control calculation behavior.
Available modes via [**CalcModeType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calcmodetype/) enum:
- `AUTOMATIC`
- `AUTOMATIC_EXCEPT_TABLE`
- `MANUAL`
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Load existing workbook or create new instance
2. Access workbook settings
3. Set calculation mode using `formula_settings.calculation_mode`
4. Save modified workbook
```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook, CalcModeType
# Load source workbook
workbook = Workbook("source.xlsx")
# Configure manual calculation mode
workbook.settings.formula_settings.calculation_mode = CalcModeType.MANUAL
# Save modified workbook
workbook.save("output.xlsx")
```
```python
import os
from aspose.cells import Workbook, CalcModeType, SaveFormat
# For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-.NET
# The path to the documents directory.
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
data_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "data")
# Create a workbook
workbook = Workbook()
# Set the Formula Calculation Mode to Manual
workbook.settings.formula_settings.calculation_mode = CalcModeType.MANUAL
# Save the workbook
output_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "output_out.xlsx")
workbook.save(output_path, SaveFormat.XLSX)
```
