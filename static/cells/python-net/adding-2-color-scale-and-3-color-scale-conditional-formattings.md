##Adding 2-Color Scale and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings
How to use the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET library to add conditional formatting for two color ratios and three color ratios. By adjusting these criteria, you have more control over how cells look and appear.
**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they are differed by [**FormatCondition.color_scale.is_3_color_scale**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/colorscale/is_3_color_scale) property. This property is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.
The following sample code adds 2-Color and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings. It generates the [output excel file](5115058.xlsx).
