##Output Blank Page when there is Nothing to Print
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
If the sheet is empty, then Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET will not print anything when you export worksheet to image. You can change this behavior by using [**ImageOrPrintOptions.output_blank_page_when_nothing_to_print**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/output_blank_page_when_nothing_to_print) property. When you will set it **true**, it will print the blank page.
## **Output Blank Page when there is Nothing to Print**
The following sample code creates the empty workbook which has an empty worksheet and renders the empty worksheet to an image after setting the [**ImageOrPrintOptions.output_blank_page_when_nothing_to_print**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions/output_blank_page_when_nothing_to_print) property as **true**. Consequently, it generates the blank page as there is nothing to print which you can see in the image below.
