##Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [**Shape.text_body.text_alignment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/fontsettingcollection/text_alignment) property. This property returns the object of [**ShapeTextAlignment**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class which has different properties e.g. [**top_margin_pt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/top_margin_pt), [**left_margin_pt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/left_margin_pt), [**bottom_margin_pt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/bottom_margin_pt), [**right_margin_pt**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/right_margin_pt), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom and right margins.
## **Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet**
Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](61767851.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](61767852.xlsx) generated by the code and screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.
