##Add Digital Signature to an already signed Excel file
This article describes how to Add Digital Signature to an already signed Excel file using C# codes with Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Workbook.add_digital_signature**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/add_digital_signature) method that you can use to add digital signature to an already signed Excel file.
Please note while adding a digital signature to an already signed Excel document, if the original document is Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET generated document, it works well. But if the original document is generated by other engines (e.g. Microsoft Excel etc.), Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET cannot keep the file same after loading and re-saving it, this will make the original signature to be invalid.
