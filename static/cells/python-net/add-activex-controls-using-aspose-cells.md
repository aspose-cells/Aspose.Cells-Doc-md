##Add ActiveX Controls
You can add ActiveX controls with Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET using the [**ShapeCollection.add_active_x_control()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapecollection/add_active_x_control) method. This method takes a parameter [**ControlType**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/controltype)Â which tells what type of ActiveX control needs to be added inside a worksheet. It has the following values.
- ControlType.COMMAND_BUTTON
- ControlType.COMBO_BOX
- ControlType.CHECK_BOX
- ControlType.LIST_BOX
- ControlType.TEXT_BOX
- ControlType.SPIN_BUTTON
- ControlType.RADIO_BUTTON
- ControlType.LABEL
- ControlType.IMAGE
- ControlType.TOGGLE_BUTTON
- ControlType.SCROLL_BAR
- ControlType.BAR_CODE
- ControlType.UNKNOWN
Once, you have added the ActiveX control inside the shape collection, you can then access the ActiveX control object via [**Shape.active_x_control**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/active_x_control) property and then set its various properties.
The following sample code adds Toggle Button ActiveX Control using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
