Sometimes, you need to generate images of Conditional Formatting DataBars.

This article shows how to generate a DataBar image using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
The following sample code generates the DataBar image of cell C1. First, it accesses the format condition object of the cell, and then from that object, it accesses the [**DataBar**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar) object and uses its [**to_image()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/to_image)Â method to generate the image of the cell.
