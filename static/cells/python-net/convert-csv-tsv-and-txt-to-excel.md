##Convert CSV, TSV and TXT to Excel

## **Opening CSV Files**
Comma Separated Values (CSV) files contain records where the values are separated by commas. Data is stored as a table where each column is separated by the comma character and quoted by the double quote character. If a field value contains a double quote character it is escaped with a pair of double quote characters. You can also use Microsoft Excel to export spreadsheet data to CSV.
## **Opening CSV files and replacing invalid characters**
In Excel, when CSV file with special characters is opened, the characters are automatically replaced. The same is done by Aspose.Cells API which is demonstrated in the code example given below.
## **Opening Tab Delimited Files**
Tab delimited (Text) file contains spreadsheet data but without any formatting. Data is arranged in rows and columns like in tables and spreadsheets. Basically, a tab delimited file is a special kind of plain text file with a tab between each column.
