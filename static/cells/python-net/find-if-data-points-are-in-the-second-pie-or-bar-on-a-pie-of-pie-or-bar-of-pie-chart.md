##Find if Data Points are in the Second Pie or Bar on a Pie of Pie or Bar of Pie Chart
Learn how to use Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET to find if data points are in the second pie or bar on a pie of pie or bar of pie chart. Our guide will demonstrate how to identify and access the secondary pie or bar on a composite chart, allowing you to analyze and manipulate the data effectively.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
You can find if data points of series are in the second pie on *Pie of Pie* chart or in the bar of *Bar of Pie* chart using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET. Please use the [ChartPoint.is_in_secondary_plot](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint/is_in_secondary_plot) property to determine it.
Please download the [sample excel file](5115193.xlsx) used in the following sample code and see its console output. If you open the [sample excel file](5115193.xlsx), you will find, all the data points which are less than 10 are inside the bar of *Bar of Pie* chart as also shown by console output.
## **Find if Data Points are in the Second Pie or Bar on a Pie of Pie or Bar of Pie Chart**
The following sample code shows how to find if data points are in the second pie or bar on a *Pie of Pie* or *Bar of Pie* chart.
## **Console Output**
Please see the following console output generated after the execution of the above sample code with the [sample excel file](5115193.xlsx). If [is_in_secondary_plot](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint/is_in_secondary_plot/) is **false**, the data point is inside the Pie or if it is **true**, then the data point is inside the Bar.
