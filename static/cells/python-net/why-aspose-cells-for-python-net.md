Let's start from practical applications and compare the three strongest Python libraries (**pandas**, **xlwings**, and **Aspose.Cells for Python via NET**) for reading data from [sample file](sample_data.xlsx).
### Read data from Excel File Using Aspose.Cells for Python via NET
### Read data from Excel File Using xlwings
### Read data from Excel File Using pandas
## **Write data to Excel File**
Let's start from practical applications and compare the three strongest Python libraries (**pandas**, **xlwings**, and **Aspose.Cells for Python via NET**) for writing data to Excel file.
### Write data to Excel File Using Aspose.Cells for Python via NET
### Write data to Excel File Using xlwings
### Write data to Excel File Using pandas
## **Add chart to Excel File**
Let's start from practical applications and compare the three strongest Python libraries (**pandas**, **xlwings**, and **Aspose.Cells for Python via NET**) for adding chart to Excel file.
### Add chart to Excel File Using Aspose.Cells for Python via NET
### Add chart to Excel File Using xlwings
### Add chart to Excel File Using pandas
In Pandas, you can use the ExcelWriter object and the to_excel() function to add charts to an Excel file. However, please note that Pandas itself does not support embedding charts directly into Excel files, it can only write data into Excel files. To add a chart, you need to use the openpyxl or xlsxwriter library to manipulate Excel files. Here is an example of using the xlsxwriter library to add a chart to an Excel file.
