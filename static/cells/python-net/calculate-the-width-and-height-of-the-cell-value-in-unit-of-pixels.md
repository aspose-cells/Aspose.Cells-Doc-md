##Measure the Width and Height of the Cell Value in Unit of Pixels
Learn how to Measure the Width and Height of the Cell Value in Unit of Pixels through the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API.
Sometimes you need to calculate the width and height of cell value to fit the cell value inside the cell. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Cell.get_width_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_width_of_value/#) and [**Cell.get_height_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_height_of_value/#) methods for this purpose. By using these methods you can calculate width and height of the cell value and then set the width of the column and height of the row of that cell respectively and this will then adjust or fit the cell value inside the cell.
Alternatively, you can also autofit rows and columns of your cell or range of cells using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET APIs.
The following code explains the use of [**Cell.get_width_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_width_of_value/#) and [**Cell.get_height_of_value()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell/get_height_of_value/#)Â methods.
