##Get Worksheet of the Chart
Learn how to retrieve the worksheet associated with an Excel chart using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET. Our guide will show you how to access the worksheet and perform operations on it to manipulate the underlying data of the chart.
Sometimes, you want to access a worksheet from a chart's reference. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides the [**Chart.worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/worksheet) property which returns the reference of the worksheet that contains the chart.
The following example shows how to use the [**Chart.worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/worksheet) property. The code first prints the name of the worksheet, then accesses the first chart on the worksheet. It then prints the worksheet name again, using the [**Chart.worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/worksheet) property.
Below is the console output that the sample code results in. As you can see, it prints the same worksheet name both times.
Sheet Name: Portfolio
Chart's Sheet Name: Portfolio
