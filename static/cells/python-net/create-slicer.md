##Insert Slicer
Manage slicers of Excel files with Aspose.Cells.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
A slicer is used to filter data quickly. It can be used to filter data both in a table or pivot table. Microsoft Excel allows you to create slicer by selecting a table or pivot table and then clicking the *Insert > Slicer*. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET also allows you to create slicer using the [**Worksheet.slicers.add()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.slicers/slicercollection/add/#aspose.cells.pivot.PivotTable-int-int-aspose.cells.pivot.PivotField) method.
## **How to Create Slicer to a Pivot Table Using Aspose.Cells for Python Excel Library**
Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](67338470.xlsx) that contains the pivot table. It then creates the slicer based on the first base pivot field. Finally, it saves the workbook in [output XLSX](67338471.xlsx) and [output XLSB](67338472.xlsb) format. The following screenshot shows the slicer created by Aspose.Cells in the output Excel file.
