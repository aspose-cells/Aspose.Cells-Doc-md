##Create, Manipulate, or Remove Scenarios from Worksheets with Python via .NET
Learn how to create, modify, and delete scenarios in Excel worksheets programmatically using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API.
Sometimes you need to create, manipulate, or delete scenarios in spreadsheets. A scenario is a named 'what if?' model that includes variable input cells linked by one or more formulas. Before creating a scenario, design the worksheet so it contains at least one formula that depends on cells which can accept different values. This example demonstrates how to manage scenarios in worksheets using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
Aspose.Cells provides several classes for working with scenarios:
- [**ScenarioCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/scenariocollection/)
- [**Scenario**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/scenario/)
- [**ScenarioInputCellCollection**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/scenarioinputcellcollection/)
- [**ScenarioInputCell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/scenarioinputcell/)
Use the [**Worksheet.scenarios**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/scenarios/) property to access scenarios. The following code demonstrates how to:
1. Open an Excel file containing scenarios
2. Remove an existing scenario
3. Add a new scenario
4. Save the modified workbook
```python
import os
from aspose.cells import Workbook
# For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-.NET
# The path to the documents directory.
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
data_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "data")
# Instantiate the Workbook and load an Excel file
workbook = Workbook(os.path.join(data_dir, "aspose-sample.xlsx"))
# Access first worksheet
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
if len(worksheet.scenarios) > 0:
# Remove the existing first scenario from the sheet
worksheet.scenarios.remove_at(0)
# Create a scenario
i = worksheet.scenarios.add("MyScenario")
# Get the scenario
scenario = worksheet.scenarios[i]
# Add comment to it
scenario.comment = "Test sceanrio is created."
# Get the input cells for the scenario
sic = scenario.input_cells
# Add the scenario on B4 (as changing cell) with default value
sic.add(3, 1, "1100000")
output_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "outBk_scenarios1.out.xlsx")
# Save the Excel file
workbook.save(output_path)
print(f"\nProcess completed successfully.\nFile saved at {output_path}")
```
