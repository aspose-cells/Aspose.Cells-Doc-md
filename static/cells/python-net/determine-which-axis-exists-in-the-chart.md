##Determine which Axis exists in the Chart
Learn how to determine which axis exists in a chart created using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET. Our guide will help you understand how to identify and access the different axes in a chart, including category, value, and secondary axes.
Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the Chart. For example, he wants to know if a Secondary Value Axis exists inside the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded, etc. do not have an axis.
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Chart.has_axis(AxisType axis_type, bool is_primary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/has_axis) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.
The following sample code demonstrates the use of [**Chart.has_axis(AxisType axis_type, bool is_primary)**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart/has_axis)Â to determine if the sample chart has Primary and Secondary Category and Value Axis.
## C# code to determine which axis exists in the chart
## Console output generated by the sample code
The console output of the code has been shown below which displays true for Primary Category and Value Axis and false for Secondary Category and Value Axis.
Has Primary Category Axis: True
Has Secondary Category Axis: False
Has Primary Value Axis: True
Has Secondary Value Axis: False
