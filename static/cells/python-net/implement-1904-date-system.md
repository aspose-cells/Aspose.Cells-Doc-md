##Implement 1904 Date System
Aspose.Cells is a Python library for working with spreadsheet files. It supports the implementation of the 1904 date system, allowing users to calculate and format based on the January 1, 1904 date system. This article describes how to implement the 1904 date system using the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET library.
Microsoft Excel supports two date systems: 1900 date system (the default date system implemented in Excel for Windows) and 1904 date system. The 1904 date system is normally used to provide compatibility with Macintosh Excel files and is the default system if you are using Excel for Macintosh. You can set the 1904 date system for Excel files using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
