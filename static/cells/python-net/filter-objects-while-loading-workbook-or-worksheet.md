##Filter Objects while loading Workbook or Worksheet
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Please use [LoadOptions.load_filter](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/loadoptions/load_filter) property while filtering data from the workbook.

## **Filter Objects while loading Workbook**
The following sample code illustrates how to filter charts from the workbook. Please check the [sample excel file](5115258.xlsx) used in this code and the [output PDF](5115257.pdf) generated by it. As you can see in the output PDF, all charts have been filtered out of the workbook.
