##Detect if Worksheet is Password Protected
It is possible to protect the workbooks and worksheets separately. For instance, a spreadsheet may contain one or more worksheets that are password-protected, however, the spreadsheet itself may or may not be protected. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET APIs provide the means to detect if a given worksheet is password protected or not. This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API to achieve the same.
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET has exposed the [**Protection.is_protected_with_password**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/protection/is_protected_with_password) property to detect if a worksheet is password protected or not. Boolean type [**Protection.is_protected_with_password**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/protection/is_protected_with_password) property returns **true** if [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet) is password-protected and **false** if not.
