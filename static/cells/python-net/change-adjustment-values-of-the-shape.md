##Change Adjustment Values of the Shape
This article shows how to Change Adjustment Values of the Shape through the Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API.
Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET provides [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to make changes to the adjustment points with shapes. In the Microsoft Excel UI, adjustments display as yellow diamond nodes. For example:
- Rounded Rectangle has an adjustment to change the arc
- Triangle has an adjustment to change the location of the point
- Trapezoid has an adjustment to change the width of the top
- Arrows have two adjustments to change the shape of the head and tail
This article will explain the use of [**Shape.geometry.shape_adjust_values**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/shape_adjust_values/) property to change the adjustment value of the different shapes.
The below code sample shows how to change adjustment values of the shape.
