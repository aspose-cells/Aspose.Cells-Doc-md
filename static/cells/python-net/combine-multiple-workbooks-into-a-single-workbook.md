##Combine Multiple Workbooks into a Single Workbook
Sometimes, you need to combine workbooks with various content like images, charts and data into a single workbook. Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET supports this feature. This article shows how to create a console application in Visual Studio and combine workbooks with a few, simple lines of code using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET.
## **Combining Workbooks with Images and Charts**
The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [**Workbook.combine()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/combine) method to combine them and saves the output workbook.
### **Source Workbooks**
