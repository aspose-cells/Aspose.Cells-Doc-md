##Setting ScaleCrop and LinksUpToDate properties of Built-In Document Properties
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
[scale_crop](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/scale_crop) and [links_up_to_date](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/links_up_to_date) are two extended built-in document properties defined inside the OpenXml format. The purpose of these properties are following
## **1) ScaleCrop**
This element indicates the display mode of the document thumbnail. Set this element to **TRUE** to enable scaling of the document thumbnail to the display. Set this element to **FALSE** to enable cropping of the document thumbnail to show only sections that fit the display.
The possible values for this element are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype.
## **2) LinksUpToDate**
This element indicates whether hyperlinks in a document are up-to-date. Set this element to **TRUE** to indicate that hyperlinks are updated. Set this element to **FALSE** to indicate that hyperlinks are outdated.
The possible values for this element are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype.
