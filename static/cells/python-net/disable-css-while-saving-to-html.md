##Disable CSS while Saving to HTML with Python.NET
Learn how to disable CSS styles when saving Excel files to HTML format using Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API.
## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When you save your Excel file to a single page HTML, usually the CSS elements will be embedded within the HTML file and will be located in the HEAD section. If you attach this file as a content/body of an email, the CSS elements will be stripped out by most email clients, resulting in improper rendering. The Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API introduces an option which allows you to optionally disable CSS, allowing styles to be directly applied within the HTML elements themselves. If you want to set the HTML as the content/body of the email, please use the [**HtmlSaveOptions.disable_css**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/disable_css/) property and set it to **True**.
## **Disable CSS while Saving to HTML**
The following sample code shows the usage of [**HtmlSaveOptions.disable_css**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/disable_css/) property.
## **Sample Code**
```python
import os
from aspose.cells import Workbook, HtmlSaveOptions
# For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-.NET
# Load sample workbook
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
source_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "source")
output_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "output")
wb = Workbook(os.path.join(source_dir, "sampleDisableCss.xlsx"))
# Disable CSS
opts = HtmlSaveOptions()
opts.disable_css = True
# Create output directory if not exists
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
# Save the workbook in html
wb.save(os.path.join(output_dir, "outputDisable.html"), opts)
```
