## **Aspose.Cells - Formula Calculation Engine**
The formula calculation engine is embedded in Aspose.Cells. It can not only re-calculate the formula imported from a designer spreadsheet file but also supports to calculate the results of formulas added at runtime.

**Java**

 //Instantiating a Workbook object

Workbook book = new Workbook();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet

int sheetIndex = book.getWorksheets().add();

Worksheet worksheet = book.getWorksheets().get(sheetIndex);

Cells cells = worksheet.getCells();

Cell cell = null;

//Adding a value to "A1" cell

cell = cells.get("A1");

cell.setValue(1);

//Adding a value to "A2" cell

cell = cells.get("A2");

cell.setValue(2);

//Adding a value to "A3" cell

cell = cells.get("A3");

cell.setValue(3);

//Adding a SUM formula to "A4" cell

cell = cells.get("A4");

cell.setFormula("=SUM(A1:A3)");

//Calculating the results of formulas

book.calculateFormula();

//Saving the Excel file

book.save(dataDir + "AsposeFormulaEngine.xls");
