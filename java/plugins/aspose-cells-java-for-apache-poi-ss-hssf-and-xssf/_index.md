## **Introduction**
### **Apache POI SS - HSSF and XSSF**
**HSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel '97(-2007) file format.
**XSSF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format.

HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets. They provide:

- low level structures for those with special needs
- an eventmodel api for efficient read-only access
- a full usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying XLS files
