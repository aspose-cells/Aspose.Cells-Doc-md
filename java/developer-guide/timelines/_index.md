## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

A timeline is used to filter data quickly. It can be used to filter data in a pivot table. Microsoft Excel allows you to create timeline by selecting a pivot table and then clicking the *Insert > Timeline*. Aspose.Cells for java also allows you to create timeline using theÂ [**Worksheet.getTimelines.add()**] method.

## **Create Timeline to a Pivot Table**

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](input.xlsx) that contains the pivot table. It then creates the timeline based on the first base pivot field. Finally, it saves the workbook in [output XLSX](output.xlsx) format. The following screenshot shows the timeline created by Aspose.Cells in the output Excel file.
