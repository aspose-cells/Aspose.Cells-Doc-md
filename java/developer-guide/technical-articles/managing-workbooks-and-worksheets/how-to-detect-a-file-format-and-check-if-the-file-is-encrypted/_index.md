Sometimes you need to detect a file's format before opening it because the file extension does not guarantee that the file content is appropriate. The file might be encrypted (a password-protected file) so it can't be read it directly, or we should not read it. Aspose.Cells provides the [**FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/fileformatutil#detectFileFormat(java.io.InputStream)) static method and some relevant APIs which you can use to process documents.
