Microsoft Excel provides a feature to add **Signature Line** in Excel workbooks. You can add a Signature Line by clicking the **Insert** Tab and then selecting **Signature Line** from the **Text** group.

Aspose.Cells also provides this feature and has exposed the [**Picture.setSignatureLine()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/picture#SignatureLine) property for this purpose. This article will explain how to use this property to add a Signature Line using Aspose.Cells.
