## **Combining Workbooks**

The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells for Java. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [**Workbook.combine()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#combine(com.aspose.cells.Workbook))Â method to combine them and saves the output workbook.

### **Source Workbooks**

- [charts.xlsx](5473097.xlsx)
- [picture.xlsx](5473096.xlsx)

### **Output Workbooks**

- [combined.xlsx](5473095.xlsx)

### **Screenshots**

Below are screenshots of the source and output workbooks.
