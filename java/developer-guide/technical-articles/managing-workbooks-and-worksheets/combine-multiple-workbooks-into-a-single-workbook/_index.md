### **Combining Workbooks**
The example code combines two workbooks into a single workbook using Aspose.Cells for Java. The code loads the source workbooks, uses the [Workbook.combine()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/workbook#combine\(com.aspose.cells.Workbook\))Â method to combine them and saves the output workbook.
#### **Source Workbooks**
