Normally, [named ranges](/cells/java/named-ranges/) are rectangular with cells continuous and adjacent to each other. But sometimes, you may need to use a non-sequential cell range in which cells are not adjacent. Aspose.Cells supports creating a named range with non-adjacent cells. For this, the API provides the [**Name.RefersTo**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/name#RefersTo) property.

## Java code to implement non-sequential ranges

The code sample below shows how to create a named non-sequential range with Aspose.Cells for Java.
