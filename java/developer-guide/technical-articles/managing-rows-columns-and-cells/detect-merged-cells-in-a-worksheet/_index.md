In Microsoft Excel, several cells can be merged into one. This is often used to create complex tables or to create a cell that holds a heading that spans several columns.

Aspose.Cells allows you to identify merged cell areas in a worksheet. You can unmerge them too. This article provides the simplest lines of code for performing the task using Aspose.Cells.

This article provides compact instructions on how to find and then unmerge merged cells in a worksheet.

Aspose.Cells provides the [**Cells.getMergedCells**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cells#MergedCells)Â method which is used to get an ArrayList of merged cell areas.

When the code below is executed, it clears the contents of the sheet and unmerges all the cell areas before saving the file again.
