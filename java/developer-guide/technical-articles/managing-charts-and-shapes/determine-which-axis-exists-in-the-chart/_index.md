Sometimes, the user needs to know if a particular axis exists in the Chart. For example, he wants to know if a Secondary Value Axis exists inside the chart or not. Some charts like Pie, PieExploded, PiePie, PieBar, Pie3D, Pie3DExploded, Doughnut, DoughnutExploded etc. do not have an axis.

Aspose.Cells provides [**Chart.hasAxis(int axisType, boolean isPrimary)**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart#hasAxis(int,%20boolean)) method to determine if the chart has a particular axis or not.
