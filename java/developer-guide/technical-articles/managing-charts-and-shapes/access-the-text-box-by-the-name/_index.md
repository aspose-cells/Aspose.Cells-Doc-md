Earlier, text boxes are accessed by index from the [Workheet.getTextBoxes()](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/worksheet#TextBoxes) collection but now you can also access the text box by name from this collection. This is a convenient and quick way to access your text box if you already know its name.
