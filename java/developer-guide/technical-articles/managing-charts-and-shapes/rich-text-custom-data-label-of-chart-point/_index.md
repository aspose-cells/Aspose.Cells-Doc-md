You can use Aspose.Cells to create rich text custom data label of the chart point. Aspose.Cells provides the [**DataLabels.characters()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/datalabels#characters(int,%20int)) method to return the [**FontSetting**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/FontSetting)Â object which can be used to set the font properties of the text like its color, boldness, etc.
