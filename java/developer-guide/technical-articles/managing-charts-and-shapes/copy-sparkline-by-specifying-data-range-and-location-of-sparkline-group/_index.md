Microsoft Excel allows you to copy a Sparkline by specifying the Data Range and Location of Sparkline Group. Follow these steps to copy your Sparkline to other cells.

- Select the cell containing your Sparkline.
- Select **Edit Data** from the **Sparkline** section inside the **Design** tab
- Choose **Edit Group Location & Data...**
- Specify Data Range and Location and click OK.

Aspose.Cells provides the [SparklineCollection.add(dataRange, row, column)](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/SparklineCollection) method to specify the Data Range and Location of Sparkline Group.
