Sometimes, you need to find the cells with some particular style. You can use Aspose.Cells to find all such cells which have a common style. Aspose.Cells provides [FindOptions.setStyle()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/findoptions#Style) property which you can use to specify the style for searching cells.
