Aspose.Cells supports converting Microsoft Excel oriented HTML into XLS/XLSX format. It means, the HTML generated by Microsoft Excel can be converted back to XLS/XLSX format using Aspose.Cells.

Similarly, if there is some simple HTML, Aspose.Cells can convert it into HTML Rich Text. Aspose.Cells provides [**Cell.setHtmlString()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell#HtmlString) property which can take such a simple HTML and convert it to formatted cell text.
