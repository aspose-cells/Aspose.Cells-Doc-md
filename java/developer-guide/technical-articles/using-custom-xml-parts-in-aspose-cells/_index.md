Custom XML Parts are the XML data which is stored by different applications like SharePoint etc inside the excel file. This data is consumed by different applications that need it. Microsoft Excel does not make use of this data so there is no GUI to add it. You can view this data by changing the extension of **.xlsx** into **.zip** and then by opening it using **WinRAR**. The data is present inside the **customXml** folder as shown in this image.

You can add custom XML parts using Aspose.Cells via the [Workbook.getContentTypeProperties().add()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/contenttypepropertycollection#add\(java.lang.Object\)) method.
