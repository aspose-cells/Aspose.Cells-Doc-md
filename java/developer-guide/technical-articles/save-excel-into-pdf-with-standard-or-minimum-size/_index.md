By default, Aspose.Cells saves Excel into PDF with Standard size. However you can also save it with Minimum size using the [PdfSaveOptions.OptimizationType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions#OptimizationType) property. It accepts the following values

- [PdfOptimizationType.STANDARD](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/pdfoptimizationtype#STANDARD)
- [PdfOptimizationType.MINIMUM_SIZE](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cells/com.aspose.cells/pdfoptimizationtype#MINIMUM_SIZE)
