## **Possible Usage Scenarios**

Sometimes, you want to auto-populate smart marker data to other worksheets if it is too large. Suppose, your data source has 1500000 records. These are too many records for a single worksheet, then you can move the rest of the records to next worksheet.

## **Auto Populate Smart Marker Data to Other Worksheets if Data is too Large**

The following sample code has a data source which has 21 records. We want to show only 15 records in one worksheet, then the rest of the records will automatically move to the second worksheet. Please note, the second worksheet should also have the same smart marker tag and you must call [**WorkbookDesigner.process(sheetIndex, isPreserved)**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbookdesigner#process(int,%20boolean)) method for both sheets. Please check the [Microsoft Access Database file](60489777.accdb) used in this code as well as the [output Excel file](60489786.xlsx) generated by the code for a reference.
