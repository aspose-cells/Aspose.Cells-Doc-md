Aspose.Cells allows you to add bookmarks at runtime. PDF bookmarks can drastically improve the navigability of long documents. When adding bookmark links to a PDF document, you can have precise control over the exact view you want, you're not limited to linking to a page. You can set up the precise view by positioning the target page, and then create the bookmark.
