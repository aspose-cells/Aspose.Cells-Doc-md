## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Aspose.Cells APIs have exposed the [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class in order to deal with the scenarios where the user wishes to use custom labels for Subtotals in a spreadsheet. Moreover, the [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class can also be used to modify the **Other** label for the Pie chart while rendering worksheet or chart.
## **Introduction to GlobalizationSettings Class**
The [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class currently offers the following 3 methods which can be overridden in a custom class to get desired labels for the Subtotals or to render custom text for the **Other** label of a Pie chart.

1. [GlobalizationSettings.getTotalName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getTotalName\(int\)): Gets the total name of the function.
1. [GlobalizationSettings.getGrandTotalName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getGrandTotalName\(int\)): Gets the grand total name of the function.
1. [GlobalizationSettings.getOtherName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getOtherName\(\)): Gets the name of "Other" labels for Pie charts.
### **Custom Labels for Subtotals**
The [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class can be used to customize the Subtotal labels by overriding the [GlobalizationSettings.getTotalName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getTotalName\(int\)) & [GlobalizationSettings.getGrandTotalName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getGrandTotalName\(int\)) methods as demonstrated ahead.

In order to inject custom labels, it is required to assign the [WorkbookSettings.GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbooksettings#GlobalizationSettings) property to an instance of the *CustomSettings* class defined above before adding the Subtotals to the worksheet.

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

The [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class only works for adding new Subtotals. If a spreadsheet already contains Subtotals, their labels cannot be modified.

### **Custom Text for Other Label of Pie Chart**
The [GlobalizationSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class offers the [getOtherName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getOtherName\(\)) method which is useful to give the "Other" label of Pie charts a custom value. The following snippet defines a custom class and overrides the [getOtherName](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/globalizationsettings#getOtherName\(\)) method to get a custom label based on default language set for JVM.



{{< gist "aspose-cells-gists" "5876dc77e47649b66bdb5deefb4b5639" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-cells-examples-articles-CustomSettings-CustomSettings.java" >}}


The following snippet loads an existing spreadsheet containing a Pie chart and renders the chart to an image while utilizing the *CustomSettings* class created above.



{{< gist "aspose-cells-gists" "5876dc77e47649b66bdb5deefb4b5639" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-cells-examples-articles-CustomTextforOtherLabelofPieChart-CustomTextforOtherLabelofPieChart.java" >}}


Following is the resultant image when locale of the machine is set to France. As you can see that the label "Other" has been translated to "Autre" as defined in *CustomSettings* class.
