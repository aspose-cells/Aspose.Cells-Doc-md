You can check if your VBA project is signed or not using Microsoft Excel via **Tools > Digital Signatures...** menu command. Similarly, you can check it programmatically using Aspose.Cells [**Workbook.getVbaProject().isSigned()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/vbaproject#IsSigned) method.

## **Check if VBA project in a Workbook is Signed**

The following code loads the workbook and checks if its VBA project is signed using [**Workbook.getVbaProject().isSigned()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/vbaproject#IsSigned)Â property.
