## Add Icons to Worksheet in Aspose.Cells

If you need to use [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) to add 'icons' in an Excel file, then this document can provide you with some help.

Here, we have prepared *sample code* to help you insert icons using [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/).There is also a necessary [sample file](sample.xlsx) and an icon [resource file](icon.zip).We used the Excel interface to insert an icon with the same display effect as the [resource file](icon.zip) in the [sample file](sample.xlsx).
