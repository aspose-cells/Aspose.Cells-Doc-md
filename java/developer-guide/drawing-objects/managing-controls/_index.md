### **Introduction**

Developers can add different drawing objects such as text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, labels, buttons, lines, rectangles, arcs, ovals, spinners, scroll bars, group boxes etc. Aspose.Cells provides the Aspose.Cells.Drawing namespace which contains all the drawing objects. However, there are a few drawing objects or shapes that are not supported yet. Create these drawing objects in a designer spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel and then import the designer spreadsheet to Aspose.Cells. Aspose.Cells allows you to load these drawing objects from a designer spreadsheet and write them to a generated file.

## **Adding TextBox Control to the Worksheet**

One way to stress important information in a report is to use a text box. For example, add text to highlight the company name or to indicate the geographic region with the highest sales etc. Aspose.Cells provides the TextBoxes class, used to add a new text box to the collection. There is another class, [**TextBox**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox), which represents a text box used to define all types of settings. It has some important members:

- The [**getTextFrame**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#TextFrame) method returns a [**MsoTextFrame**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/MsoTextFrame) object used to adjust the contents of the text box.
- The [**setPlacement**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#Placement) method specifies the placement type.
- The [**setFont**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#Font) method specifies the font attributes.
- The [**addHyperlink**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#addHyperlink(java.lang.String)) method adds a hyperlink for the text box.
- The [**FillFormat**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#FillFormat) property returns [**MsoFillFormat**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/MsoFillFormat) object used to set the fill format for the text box.
- The [**LineFormat**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#LineFormat) property returns the [**MsoLineFormat**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/MsoLineFormat) object usually used to style and weight of the text box line.
- The [**setText**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/textbox#Text) method specifies the input text for the text box.

The following example creates two textboxes in the first worksheet of the workbook. The first text box is well-furnished with different format settings. The second is a simple one.

The following output is generated by executing the code:

**Two text boxes are created in the worksheet**

## **Manipulating Text Box Controls in the Designer Spreadsheets**

Aspose.Cells also lets you access textboxes in the designer worksheets and manipulate them. Use the [**Worksheet.getTextBoxes**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/worksheet#TextBoxes) property to get the textboxes collection in the sheet.

The following example uses the Microsoft Excel file – tsttextboxes.xls – that we created in the above example. It gets the text strings of the two textboxes and changes the text of the second textbox to save the file.

## **Adding CheckBox Control to the Worksheet**

Check boxes are handy if you want to provide a way for a user to choose between two options, such as true or false; yes or no. Aspose.Cells allows you to use check boxes in worksheets. For instance, you may have developed a financial projection worksheet in which you can either account for a particular acquisition or not. In this case, you might want to place a check box at the top of the worksheet. You can then link the status of this check box to another cell, so that if the check box is selected, the value of the cell is True; if it is not selected, the value of the cell is False.

### **Using Microsoft Excel**

To place a check box control in your worksheet, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the Forms toolbar is displayed.
1. Click the **Check Box** tool on the Forms toolbar.
1. In your worksheet area, click and drag to define the rectangle that will hold the check box and the label beside the check box.
1. Once the check box is placed, move the mouse cursor into the label area and change the label.
1. In the **Cell Link** field, specify the address of the cell to which this check box should be linked.
1. Click on **OK**.

### **Using Aspose.Cells**

Aspose.Cells provides the [**CheckBoxCollection**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/checkboxcollection) class, which is used to add a new check box to the collection. There is another class, [**Aspose.Cells.Drawing.CheckBox**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/CheckBox), which represents a check box. It has some important members:

- The [**setLinkedCell**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/checkbox#LinkedCell) method specifies a cell which is linked to the check box.
- The [**setText**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/checkbox#Text) method specifies the text string associated with the check box. It is the label of the check box.
- The [**setValue**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/checkbox#Value) method specifies if the check box is checked or not.

The following example shows how to add a checkbox to the worksheet. The output below is generated after executing the code.

**A CheckBox is added in the worksheet**

## **Adding RadioButton Control to the Worksheet**

A radio button, or an option button, is a control made of a round box. The user makes his or her decision by selecting the round box. A radio button is usually, if not always, accompanied by others. Such radio buttons appear and behave as a group. The user decides which button is valid by selecting only one of them. When the user clicks one button, it is filled. When one button in the group is selected, buttons of the same group are empty.

### **Using Microsoft Excel**

To place a Radio Button control in your worksheet, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the **Forms** toolbar is displayed.
1. Click the **Option Button** tool.
1. In the worksheet, click and drag to define the rectangle that will hold the option button and the label beside the option button.
1. Once the radio button is placed in the worksheet, move the mouse cursor into the label area and change the label.
1. In the **Cell Link** field, specify the address of the cell to which this radio button should be linked.
1. Click **OK**.

### **Using Aspose.Cells**

The [**ShapeCollection**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/shapecollection) class provides a method named addShape which can be used to add a radio button control to a worksheet. The method may return a RadioButton object. The class RadioButton represents an option button. It has some important members:

- The setLinkedCell method specifies a cell which is linked to the radio button.
- The setText method specifies the text string associated with the radio button. It is the label of the radio button.
- The Checked property specifies if the radio button is checked or not.
- The setFillFormat method specifies the fill format of the radio button.
- The setLineFormat method specifies the line format styles of the option button.

The following example shows how to add radio buttons to a worksheet. The example adds three radio buttons representing age groups. The following output would be generated after executing the code.

**Some RadioButtons are added in the worksheet**

## **Adding Combo Box Control to a Worksheet**

To make data entry easier, or to limit entries to certain items that you define, you can create a combo box, or drop-down list of valid entries that is compiled from cells elsewhere on the worksheet. When you create a drop-down list for a cell, it displays an arrow next to that cell. To enter information in that cell, click the arrow, and then click the entry that you want.

### **Using Microsoft Excel**
