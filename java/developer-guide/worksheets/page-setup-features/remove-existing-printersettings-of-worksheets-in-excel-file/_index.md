## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
Sometimes developers want to prevent Excel from including *.bin* files of printer settings in the saved XLSX files. Printer settings files are located under *“[file "root"]\xl\printerSettings”*. This document explains how to remove existing printer settings using Aspose.Cells APIs.
## **Remove Existing PrinterSettings of Worksheets in Excel file**
Aspose.Cells allows you to remove existing printer settings specified for different sheets in the Excel file. The following sample code illustrates how to remove existing printer settings for all the worksheets in the workbook. Please see its [sample Excel file](45056023.xlsx), [output Excel file](45056024.xlsx), console output as well as a screenshot for a reference.
