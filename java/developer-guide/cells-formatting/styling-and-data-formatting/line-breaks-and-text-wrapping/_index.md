{{% alert color="primary" %}}

To ensure that text in a cell can be read, explicit line breaks and text wrapping can be applied. Text wrapping turns one line into several in a cell, which explicit line breaks put in breaks exactly where you want them.

## **To Wrap Text in a Cell**

To wrap text in a cell, use the [**Aspose.Cells.Style.setTextWrapped**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/style#IsTextWrapped) property.

The following sample code shows how to use text wrapping and explicit line breaks in a cell.

## **To Use Explicit Line Breaks**

You can use ‘\n’ in Java to insert the explicit line breaks in a cell.
