## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When you save your Excel file to HTML, then Aspose.Cells reveal Downlevel Conditional Comments. These conditional comments are mostly relevant to old versions of Internet Explorer and are irrelevant to modern Web Browsers. You can read about them in detail at the following link.
