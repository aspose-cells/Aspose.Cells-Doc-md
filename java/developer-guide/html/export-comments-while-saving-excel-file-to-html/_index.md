## **Possible Usage Scenarios**
When you save your Excel file into HTML, comments are not exported. However, Aspose.Cells provides this feature using the [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/javascript/cells/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property. If you set it **true**, then HTML will also display comments present in your Excel file.
## **Export Comments while Saving Excel file to Html**
The following sample code explains the usage of [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/javascript/cells/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions#IsExportComments) property. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the HTML when the property is set to **true**.
