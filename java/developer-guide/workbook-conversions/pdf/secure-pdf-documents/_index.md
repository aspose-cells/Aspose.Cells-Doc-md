If the spreadsheet contains formulas, it is best to call [**Workbook.calculateFormula()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook#calculateFormula()) just before rendering it to PDF. This ensures that formula dependent values are recalculated, and the correct values are rendered in the PDF.
