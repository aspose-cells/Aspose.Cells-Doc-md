Firstly make sure that you have the ADT bundle installed and that you have downloaded the latest version of Aspose.Cells for Android via Java.

- Extract the **aspose-cells-X.X.X.jar** from the latest release archive and add it to a new folder under the example you want to run. Add the file under a folder called **libs**.
- Open the project in your workspace using Eclipse with ADT.
- Click **Run** to start and choose the appropriate emulator to run the package on.
