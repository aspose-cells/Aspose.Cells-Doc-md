This section describes how to install and uninstall Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services.

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services can be deployed in two ways:

- using a full MSI installer or
- using a single DLL.

Both the installer and the DLL are available for free download at the Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services [download page](https://downloads.aspose.com/cells/reportingservices).

Using the installer has a couple of advantages:

1. It makes all necessary entries into the system registry to expose Microsoft Excel to COM applications.
1. It contains the demo projects that allow you to obtain code samples.
