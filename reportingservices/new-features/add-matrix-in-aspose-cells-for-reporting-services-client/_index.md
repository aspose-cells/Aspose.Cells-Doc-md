We incorporated support to create a matrix report item in a report. The matrix context includes corner, column groupings, row groupings and matrix rows. Set matrix report attributes which include name, range and so on through **Set Attribute** button in Aspose.Cellsâ€™ command bar in Excel.

For example, in the screenshot below, the matrix range is E9:G11.
