A digital signature provides assurance that a workbook is valid and no one has altered it. Attaching a digital signature is similar to sealing an envelope. If an envelope arrives sealed, you have some level of assurance that no one has tampered with its contents. 

You can create a personal digital signature by using the Microsoft Selfcert.exe or any other tool, or you can purchase a digital signature. To sign a spreadsheet, attach a signature to your workbooks once you have created a digital signature. 

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services supports digital signatures.

### **Working with Digital Signatures**
#### **Supported Excel Formats for Digital Signatures**
Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services supports digital signatures when exporting to Excel 2007 and ODS file formats.
#### **Configuring Digital Signatures**
The **Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices.xml** file holds the configuration information and text of a digital signature in the <DigitalSignature> tag:

- When DigitalSignature is set to off, Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services turns off the digital signature functionality.
  For example: 

{{< highlight java >}}

 <DigitalSignature value="off">

<report name="" pfxFilename="" pfxPwd="" purpose=""/>

</DigitalSignature>

{{< /highlight >}}

- When the value of DigitalSignature is on, Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices turns on the functionality of digital signature.
  For example: 

{{< highlight java >}}

 <DigitalSignature value="on">

{{< /highlight >}}

There are four parameters in DigitalSignature section. These are : 

- name – Points to a report that needs a digital signature. The report uses a PFX file for digital signature when the parameter is blank.
- pfxFilename – Points to the PFX file. The filename must be a complete filename. It cannot be set to a blank value.
- pfxPwd – Sets the password. It cannot be left blank.
- purpose – Explains the signature's purpose. It can be blank.
  For example: 

{{< highlight java >}}

 <DigitalSignature value="on">

<report name="TestReport" pfxFilename="c:\MyKey.pfx" pfxPwd="tryto" purpose="test digital signature"/>

<report name="" pfxFilename="c:\MyKey.pfx" pfxPwd="tryto" purpose="test digital signature"/>

</DigitalSignature>

{{< /highlight >}}
